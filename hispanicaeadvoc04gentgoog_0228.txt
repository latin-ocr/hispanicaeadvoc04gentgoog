thing itself hasbeen stolen. Menochius teaches these doctrines with·
out hesitation, ¹¹¹¹ and other writers say that under the civil law no
interdict may be directed against one who holds from a robber, but
that all possessory remedies apply to recovering the possession of
personal property only against a possessor with a clear defect in his
title. ls there anything then to delay a verdict forus and the
release of possession, if there is no one of those remedies which
are granted to those who have been robbed that may in this case
be directed against us? Even supposing that all of thern were
granted, since we have proved our property, and since our adver·
saries have not introduced other remedies, judgment conceming our
property must now be given in our behalf, as I have said.

Pray‚ why should one hesitare about the propriety of canceling
the sequestratim? ¹¹ Sequestration is hatefu13 it is forbidden, so that
every possessor, however forcibly he may maintain his claim, ought
to be protected in his right of possession. kkSequestration ought
not to be employed against honorable men, who would not wish to
squander property, etc. ¹¹ The rule is quite clear that it is canceled

200 and held in check by a bond. Even by a juratory bond, I say, it is
canceled, although Jason vigorously denies this doctrine, and cites
in his support speculator, Butrius, lmola, Panormitanus, Alexander,
as well as Albericus, that very experienced and trustworthy doctor,
who, he says, has always seen the principle followed which he advo·
cates. Here in like manner is the practice followed of supplanting
the bond by sequestration and of not receiving it? But these argu-
ments do not stand in the way, and l assert the opposite opinion,
for the citations given above apply to a debtor under suspicion. lt
is clear that all the doctors mentioned above are teaching doc·
trines which concern a man under suspicion. Thus Jason himself
on the law ”¹¹¹¹ which deals with one under suspicion says, “and the
person may be under suspicion.” Furthermore, there is no doubt
that those who expound a law should be interpreted according to the
words of the law to which they refer. Or what point is there in
discussing a matter? ¹²¹¹ Thus Speculator, the leading authority of
Jason, says: “But suppose Titius is in debt to me, and has no real

under suspicion,'' etc. This is the attitude of the rest, and consequently
in the case of one who is not under suspicion the opposite view is more
correct, and everybody holds the opposite view. vvlndeed, the lm·
perial Chamber, following the laws and their expounders-and one
may see its opinion in Gaillius and Mynsingerus—explicitly notes that
a sequestration may be canceled by a juratory bond, if the person
against whom it has been made be honorable, be known to lead an
