was not ordained a priest in due lorrn who lacked about lorty
255 days ol passing beyond his twenty-fourth year, no matter how little
the one who ordered his ordination thought there was in those days;
because the candidate lor ordination ought to have finished that year,
that is, to bave passed beyond it and touched his twenty-fifth year,
says Navarrus. And there are other statements to this ellect and
very many statements about the strIct interpretation of the statutas.
However, these consideratione are not decisive, and I think
that the opposite view in the proposed question is in harmony with
the law, so that that youth, lor example, may be elected to the college
in accordance with the statute. Now, I am led to adopt this view
by the consideration “that the doctors without exception give as
their opinion that, in the case of gilts and honors and beneficent

things, it is indeed sufficient to have touched the year; and that in
those cases time begun is regarded as time completed. This view too
Panormitanus says is the common one, although he himself thinks
the law is otherwise.

Resides, no difficulty is caused by the fact that the law ex·
pressly mentions the completion ol the year3 ⁸⁸ for it is certain that
statutes are brought under the interpretation of the common law.
¹²¹² This gives rise to that delinition among others, in this matter ol
electione, that il there is a statute to the effect that a man is to be
elected to a college hythe consent ol all, the statute, in accordance
with the common law, is understood to mean “ by the consent of the
majority.” Statutes receive this interpretation, which is called “ pas·
sive,'’ from the common law. This is the general view of all with
reference to the law omnes populi.¹

ἢΤὴεη, tou, we are right in getting this result by wresting the
words of the statute from their usual meaning, in spite of the fact
that there is a statute to the ellect that statutes are to be inter·
preted literally. klNow, too, concerning this statute the view is
expressed that it has little orno ellect. ¹¹ It is the casuistical inter·
pretation alone that this statute excludes3 it does not exclude that
which is in accord with the common law. Μ For this is not only an
acceptable, but also the necessary interpretation.

256 ¹¹¹¹ Statutes must be understood according to the rules ol the law,
and never in such a way that they become at variance with a case
decided according to the common law. ⁰⁰ The wording ol statutes
must be brought into harmony with the interpretation of the common .
law. ⁹⁹ We must understand statutes in harmony with the art ol
men of letters, and thus there are countless cases in which there is no
doubt. l note once more Baldus's statement about electing by the
consent ol all, and that this statute isto be understood, in accordance
