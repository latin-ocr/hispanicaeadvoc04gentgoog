The Pleas ol a Spattish Advocato, Bk. ll. 197

matter if we do say that even the wisest men are deceived in regard
to fac'llic fourth point does not create difficulty, “because the stay
and revicw, granted by the interlocutory decree, ol the execution
would cause no small prejudice. The Spanish ambassador would have
a very just reason lor action. He has failed to ask to have judgcs

associated with a judge who is under serious suspicion; indeed, he has
not rejected a hostile judge, ¹¹¹²and he had the right even on this

score to reject him in every case, because in one case an appeal lrom
him was pending. Or if under the civil law, which we are following
in this court ol the admiralty, this is not the case, or if the civil law
takes another attitude than the canon law, and we should not have
that right, at all events we have the right to associate judges, and not
to have asked lor them could be an error on the part ol the ambas·
sudor, He had a judge who was under suspicion, and he toolc care to
have him warned by the supreme council ol our King, buthe made a
mistalce, because he trusted the authority ol the council more than he
learcd the hostile, irritated temper of the judge. ίίΑ revision is
granted even when an error is attributed to him who asks revision.
Thus the lourth argument also on the other side is reluted. What is
said above ol a dclay lor a comparativcly short time counts lor
nothing in this case where the question is not one ol time.

The filth argument presents no difficulty, because in reality in
this case petition was made in writing. The ambassador gave to the
King in writing a summary of the whole procedure; he gave a letter ·
to the King; he petitioned the King, in the form in which an ambas·
sador should petition a King. kkAccording to the standing ol the
persons concerned these matters are transacted, as Rebuflus well puts
it in this treatise on the subject ol petitions. He adds too that oral
petitione are of as much weight as written ones3 and that the same
is true of appeals. ¹¹ Now, il in the case ol an appeal from an inter·
locutory decree a document is not necessary, as the common ,opinion
stands, and as is undoubtedly true under the civil law, no· strong
reason will be given why one should be necessary in the case of a 195
petttron.

The sixth argument presents no difficulty, Μ because in point of
lact a verdict pronounced after an appeal from an interlocutory
decree will not be turned over lor execution, while the appeal is
pending, lor the validity ol the verdict too depends on the outcome
of the interlocutory decree. Manifestly‚ il the appeal lrorn the in·
terlocutory decree held, the definitive decree did not, since it was
pronounced by a judge whose jurisdiction had been suspended, as
Panormitanus well puts it. The case is not even injured by the lact
that the judge from whose interlocutory decree an appeal has been
