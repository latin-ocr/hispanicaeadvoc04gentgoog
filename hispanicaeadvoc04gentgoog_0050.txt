CHAPTER VI

W herber It Is Lawful to conduct un Enemy Captive through
Anothefls Territory

'All writers agree that it is not unlawlul to transport grain

through a place, from which it is still unlawful to export it, so that
it may be regarded also as lawful to conduct property taken from the
enemy and to conduct the enemy captive through that territory,
lrom which still it might not be lawful to take them. ''Then it is an
undoubted fact, says Decianus, that, ii a captive be led to prison
through the graveyard ol a church, he will not be safe on that
account, but may be taken from there. He states too that this is the
opinion of Archidiaconus, oi Oldradus, and of many others, that
it is the more correct doctrine, a doctrine to be accepted, and one
observcd in practice. eOther authors too may be added to the au·
thorities cited by Decianus, via, Albericus, Caepolla, and others.

Caepolla literally says that a criminal who has been taken
in a territory where seizure is permitted may be conducted through
another's territory and not be set free there. ‘¹The mere passage
through does not mean protection‚ says F elynus in a similar discus·

bidden to pass through the church, because otherwise he would be sale
there.

Again, il in another's territory it is not lawlul to seize what
belongs to the enemy, neither should what has been seized elsewhere
be released there. li it does not sufler capture there, neither may it
become free there. And vice versa, the same doctrine would hold,
and the law is consistent in all cases.

Again, is not traveling unrestricted and traveling by sea (on
this point the issue arises in my case), is it not especially treet Be·
sides, the sea and seashore are the common property ol everybody
-0 the sea, most clearly recognized as common property, says Jason.

22 Now, the Spanisb Ambassador opposes the action of the Dutch in
taking property captured from their Spanisb enemies by this route,
through the British sea and along these shores, and he asks the
magistrate here that all the property be stopped and be released.

fls it proper lor the king or for our magistrate to take lrom
