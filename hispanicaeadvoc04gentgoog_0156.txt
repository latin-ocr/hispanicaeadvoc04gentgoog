ness seems to submit a statement which hasbeen worked over. But
they are also led to this conclusion by the argument mentioned above
that the expression, the color, and the steadlastness of a witness are
observed better when he testifies without reading from a manuscript.
Salycetus himself took the position that the words of those who
gave evidence should be set down in writing by a notary. To this
point, however, Aretinus replies, as well asto another point made
by Salycetus. 'Furthermors Baldus urges this point also that a
document sent to a judge would “ in no wise ” establish a point, even
if the witness in question had taken an oath in advance in the trial.
¹Indeed Albericus makes even a more sweeping statement that it
would not, if the witness in person should bring the document to the
judge and swear that the truth was contained therein. ω Conse·
quently, archidiaconus makes the general statement that if witnesses
are absent and that if their testimony is in writing they ought “ never ’'
to be believed.

Now, the lifth argument is that of Aretinus. He makes the

12⁷ new and very sound deduction from can. relatam, ς, qu. 2² that the
same prohibition should apply to the prosecutor and the witness,
viz, that the prosecutor should not be absent, and that the witness
should not be absent and give his testimony in writing, and that,
therefore, there would be “ no ’‘ legal evidence in the one case, just
as there ‘⁴ is no '' accusation “under the law ” in the other case.
nThe sixth argumentis that others, too, would call this testi·
mony ol almost no value. “ Then shall he, whom no one would be·
lieve if he should take an oath while laying hold of an altar, establish
without an oath by means of a letter whatever he wishes? ” Cicero
says ‘¹ by means ol a letter.'‘ Apuleius in his well-known ‘⁴ Apology ‘'
before the court, upon which my brother makes an observation in this
connection, says “ from a pamphlet.” Now these are all the points
against this witness of ours which Ι have to discuss.

However, there are other points in his defense which would
make this evidence acceptable. ⁰There is Bartolus, who writes to
this ellect: “ Pray, may a witness present his testimony in a written
form? 1 think he may do so. Still it the judge should wish to see
him and to hear him speak, he may well do so, because he will see
whether he speaks in an agitated way or not.’' ¹’Moreoven Alex·
ander and Mynsingerus agree with Bartolus, and Decianus does so
in a very decided way, for he is vigorous in extolling the authority
of Bartolus. He even thinks that more credence should be given
to this one writer, as Angelus Aretinus used to say, than to all others.
qllbout the same authority Decianus also says elsewhere: “What- '

ever Baldus, Salycetus, and the others seem to maintain in ooposi·
