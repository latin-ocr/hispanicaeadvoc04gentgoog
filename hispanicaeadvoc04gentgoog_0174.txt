as a rule are not wont to be carried out without the help of con-
federates. This likewise is the common opinion and the one observed
in practice, and this opinion also applies to our case, which is a
piratical case where consedentes are concerned. Moreover, prac-
tice (Clarus too teaches this) applies this principle likewise in the
case of all crimes, at least in the case of theft and robbery. This '
can be the fifth rule in the case of our witnesses, or rather the

wahl The seventh is that they would be accepted in civil actions, and

now civil action is brought, since merely the restoration of property
is aimed at. luThus action can be taken, even though the crime

would be a publicone.

¹'The eighth point in our defense is that they are not accepted
as entirely competent witnesses, and they are believed only when they
say -what is probable. But that probable testimony is given by these
witnesses is evident from the fact that they are testifying against

themselves, ⁰and one cannot believe that a person deposes to his own
disadvantage, unless itis the ttuth that he is telling. It is clear that
the testimony is probable from the fact that the opposite would be
very improbable: that a single Dutchman, a stranger‚ of humble birth,
a poor man, acted as leader for all the rest, who were Englishmen, as

master of the whole expedition.

The ninth reply is that in this case the question turns not so
much on the evidence as on the confessione of criminals. lt would
indeed be a thing unheard of not to believe the confessions of guilty
men of this sort. vnnybody can testify against himself. qIn fact,
we believe more the confession of a principal than we do a thousand
witnesses who assert the opposite.

rThe tenth reply is that witnesses are accepted as suitable if they
are supported either by other suitable wimesses or by inferentes, and
here there are other inferences which have been mentioned above,
inferentes based on the incredible leadership and mastery held by a
Dutchman, on the credible leadership and mastery held by Eng-
lishmen. The privateer was bought in England; here it was fitted

145 out also with everything, from here it also sailed out with all the
English confederates. Would not a Dutch master have procured
everything in Holland? The English, accustomed for a very long
time during the last war to plundering expeditions of this sort, but
now being forbidden them, still cannot desist, and have thought
of these devices for covering up their deceit; they have chosen a

deceit is proved here by the unusual nature of the circumstances,
even by easily made inferences. What is not “naturally wont’' to
take place should not be believed. Now, is this “a thing naturally
