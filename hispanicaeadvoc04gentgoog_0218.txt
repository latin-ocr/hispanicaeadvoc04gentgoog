scribe that a case ought not to be determined by a judge under sus·
picion, and numberless reasons are accumulated on this point, on the
score of which this rejection may be made, and besides them the dis·
cretion of the judge in this connection is still to be considered, who
may admit other reasons also. ‘Even a slight reason ought to be
acccepted, ashthe· decision of the Rota, given by my learned friend,
antuccrus, as rt.

ln fact, the argument makes it improper fora judge to be ac·

188 cepted in these circumstances, even when other judges are associated
with him, because an appeal cannot be taken from the verdict of all
these judges, and, therefore, the reasoning of the civil law will not
hold, which forces one to take legal action before the same judge
in another case, because appeal may be taken again. Still the first
’ reason mentioned is convincing, because here there would not be a
different case, ⁸ for the point mentioned in the law which has this pro·
vision concerns a separate case, and one which does not have organic
connection with another. This reasoning is conclusive also in the case
of an ordinary judge. tlln ordinary judge, they say, cannot be re·
jected, but one may ask to have judges associated with him. Although
this is true that an ordinary judge may not be simply rejected, for be·
ing under suspicion, as another judge may be, still it is not true that he
may nothe rejected even for a just reason. No one maintains this.
¹³ In fact, everybody says that it would be correct and would be the
common conclusion in the case of an ordinary judge not liable to re·
jection. But the principle does not hold in certain special cases. The
judge is rejected in this case which very largely and almost entirely
depends upon a certain article of law, the situation being that this
judge, formerly an advocate, defended that view which, if it pre·

vail here, will clearly defeat our whole case. Α state of mind, as
we all know, may alject even opinions.
