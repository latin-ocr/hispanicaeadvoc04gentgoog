CHAPTER XX
Of the Sale os Perishable Goods

The request made by the illustrious Lord, who is in possession

213 of the sugat, that permission be granted him to sell it, has a certain
justificatiom because perishable goods ought to be sold, and sugar is
a commodity of this sort. “Those goods are called perishable which
cannot be kept by mere keeping, that is, those from which no profit
is derived by the keeping while they themselves are being kept.
Those goods are called perishable which cannot be kept in their
natural excellence “beyond three years '' without being spoiled by
the lqpse of time and becoming worse. bWe oliset these two things
tn this way, namely, those goods which can be kept without great
inconvenience‚ and, sccondly‚ those goods which it is advantageous to
sell at the earliest possible time. Under this head fall fruit, oil,
wine, grain, and similar articles about which the doctors have ex·
pressed these views in common, and of which they have given illus·
tratione. Accordingly, it would be necessary to come to the same
conclusion regarding sugar, which is not only a perishable product,
but would deteriorate with keeping, as experts have testilied in the
matter. ‘Articles of this kind ought to be sold, to use the words of

the doctors in this connection.
Now, in our case there is nothing uncertain. In their case there

would be the question, who has to do with the selling, while here
undeniable right seems to favor his Lordship. dThe man who is in
possession for the purpose of preserving a thing is the one who sells
things of this sort. Therefore, he too who has some similar claim to
possession will also ellect the sale. ‘That man has the sole tenure,
and our client certainly does not have less. ‘Furthen that case and
ours seem to be marked as on a par with reference to the question
whether perishable goods should be sold, whence too one would not be
wrong in inferring that they are also on a par with reference to this
question, who has to do the selling. ‘But note the observation of the
Imperial Privy Council, where the civil law is followed, as it is here
before the bar of the Admiralty. This observation is to the ellect
that goods of this sort should be sold by the man who is holding them.

And thus there can be no leugthy question here either.
However, there succeeds another question, namely, how those
goods should be sold. Undoubtedly at as high a price as possible,
