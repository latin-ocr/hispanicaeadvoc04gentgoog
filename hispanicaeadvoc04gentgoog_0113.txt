CHAPTER XX

Of an English stip Sailinq to Turkey with a Quantity of Poroder
ond Other Μ erchandise

If this question were raised in our country, as the advocate here
in ordinary of the Spaniards, l should either argue lor the Spaniards
or say nothing for the sake ol truth. But the question at issue is be·
ing examined in Spain, where it is surely not unbecoming on my part to

publish something written by me in defense of my English friends, ι
whether this count against the Maltese or against the Sardiniam,
when even the Spanish ambassador here, Pedro de Ztiriiga, a man
noble, eminent and distinguished for all the other virtues, sent to Spain
a commendatory letter in behali ol these same Englishmen.

The facts are that an English ship, laden with a little powder, a 81

whether already made up or not, for it would be harmful to the
Roman Empire, and would approach treason to fumish the heathen,
who ought to be without equipment, with weapons to make them
stronger. But if anyone shall have sold any kind of arms anywhere
to alien heathen of any nation whatsoever in violation ol the inter·
diets of our holy religion, we decree that all his goods be straight·
way confiscated, and that he too suller capital punishment.” bTo
this effect are the other civil laws and their expounders. They forbid
the doing of that, which in the present case is said to have been done
by the English, lor no Christian will deny that the Turks are
heathen. e“Today by serious-minded men people who are not of
