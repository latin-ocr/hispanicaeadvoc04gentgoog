CHAPTER XXV

What Has Besa Dour iu a Suu lor Possession
A LETTER ΤΟ THE AMBASSADOR

At first the opinion was secured, and without much difficulty,
that you, your Excellency, should be in possession, and that this
possession should be given to you free from sequestratius as soon
as you gave satisfactory bondsmcn3 for the objections of the oppos·
ing counsel that you, the ambassador, did not have instructions to
justify your interserente in the cases of private individuals were met
by me in two ways. Ι urged that such actions also arc part of the
charge of ambassadors, 'as Ι have indicated in my books “On Em·
bassies,” band as others following me in the same work have agreed.
eAnd those writers have added this fortunate statement, that an
ambassador should not be forced evento show his instructions. Then‚
too, I replied that you, your Excellency, did not intervcne here as
ambassador, but as any possessor whatsoever might. d Of course that
expedient tried by us is open to any possessory action whatsoever.
And all through Ι took my stand upon this second reply which cut
off inquiries at once.

a But the other objection raised, that the opposing side had been
despoiled and should receive restitution before anything else was
donc-this objection we pounced upon at once, and wc clung to it,

with tooth and nail, to support our own case; efor the man who says
he has been despoiled, confessos at the same time that he is not al·
ready in possession; and, therefore, through the maladroitness of
the other side, we gained at once what must have been long drawn
out if we had had to prove in some other way that we were in pos·
session. The opposing counsel attempted the reply that in spite of
this the possession had been retained by his clients, but this was mere
quibbling, because, as Ι said, bis clients might have civil possession,

225 ¹but this would not avail against your physical possession, against
your taking your stand thereon.

Strange, indeed, was the oversight of our opponents in not
mentioning the nullity of the opinion or appealing against it; ⁸for
in either case they would have had authorities who might have seemed
to be on the side of our opponents themselves. Our opponents might
at least have caused us dangerous delays. But with lack of foresight

they allowed the opinion to become a decision.
