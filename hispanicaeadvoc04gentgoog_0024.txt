To the Same Person.

A good and wisc man brings profit to the human racc, even after
his death. Of this, most illustrious Scipione, thy brother is a prooi, a
man above my praise, and iamed ior his merita throughout the world.
The books which he sent forth during his life, and ten times over
corrected in every jot and tittle‚ these even Themis approvcs. ·

Themis approves likewise those which, death forbidding, he
, could not publish. Now may affection drive thy soul on to bring

to light his posthumous works. Hence, as gratitude is due to thy
brother, the author, deep gratitude attends thee also. This noble
proof of thy brotherly loyalty and love generations to come will
ἕης (if, auli glory, whiclh kioweth not death will carry the brothers

Consano errnsuurs,
Brother-jurio.
