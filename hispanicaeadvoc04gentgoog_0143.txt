01 Commerce with the Turks

⁸All the laws apparently say that commerce with the Turks is
forbidden. Ι, however, do not care lightly to depart from the very
definite rule ol the law of nations bwhich regulated trade relations
without making any distinction between nations. Now, other laws
could oller no difficulty; they can be answered in many ways, and
always truly. Those laws‚ whether civil or canon, do not ahect the
subjecte ol England‚ except in this way, that the English are not
allowed to have the trade relations mentioned with the enemies of
the Roman Empire; these laws do not so allect the English as to
make it just as unlawful for them to trade with the enemies ol others
as with the enemies ol England herself. cAdd that between princes
and also-and this is our case—between a prince and the subjectos 115

fore this trade would not be forbidden. The sixch reply is that it
is not possible to see any evil intent here on the part of our clients
against the Tuscans or other Christians. The seventh reply is that
it is conveyance to the Turks that is forbidden, but this is a case of
conveyance 'from the Turks‚ the transport of Turkish merchants
dwhere gold is taken from thern through the action of the civil law.
The eighth reply is that we are not here dealing with goods or
merchandise that is contraband. The ninth is that this is not a state
of war which exists between Tuscany and Turkey; they are merely
raiding against one another. eWar is a lawful struggle and a
struggle in the full sense ot the term.

The tenth reply is one that will overwhelm every opposlng
argument as with a monster wave, that the Tuscan in his wisdom
