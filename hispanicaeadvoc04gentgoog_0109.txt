CHAPTER XIX
Of Punishiny the Fault of a Magistratus

We say ⁸that fault is not taken for granted unless it is proved.
He who charges it must furnish clear and certain proof. N ay, rather,
to avoid the suspicion of imputing blame, a man is presumed to have
done what a person in his circumstances would probably do. bIn
the case of officials, diligence is especially taken for granted. We
take it for granted that officials have done their duty with diligence
and fidelity. The law makes this presumption for the benefic of
officials, and favors them. Every meticulous investigation directed
against them is forbidden.

These are the facts. cBut this point holds against officials,
that they must themselves prove that they have been honest in office.
The law says: “ It is not necessary for a ward to prove that the
trustecs appointed to act as guardiam were not suitable persons, when
they were accepted as guardians, for the proof should be required
of those whose duty it was to see to it that the interests of the ward
were safeguarded.” The doctors say that this is so because officials
have to prove that what concems their office was honestly done while
they were in office.

Or, if you should say that there is official responsibility in the
case of the ward who could not look out for himself, you would say
it the more in the case of the foreign ship belonging to the Lusi·
tanians, the ship which, since it was brought under the control of an
official, could not look out for itself in choosing suitable guards. lt
is this matter of unsuitable guards which is urged against the Vice-
Admiral. Again, even if you wish, in common with the other doctors,
to have the burden of proof in this matter rest on the magistrates,
since in the light of the present situation, when they are evidently 78
not suitable guardiam, we assume that they were not suitable
at the tirne of appointment, this consideration also counts strongly
against our official, whose guards have not-been found suitable in
point of fact. ‘¹So we reply to that general presumption in favor
of officials mentioned above, that it holds if there be no other special
presumption on the other side. ‘ln the present case I say, concern·
ing the guardiam, that even a mischance is presumed to have occurred
through the fault of those who were bound to keep guard. Upon
them too falls also the proof that it was a mischance, since they in
