The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. ll. 217 ·

as that observation also notes. But what will this bel ¹¹The price 214
at which they are “ commonly ’' sold, as the doctors say with refer·
ence to things of this sort. I should think that the valuation already
made ought to be followed and that we should be given the privilege
of selling according to that valuation; for if the valuation were now
less, the opposing side would wish this charged to us3 they would
wish to have no diminution from that price made them, and, accord·
ingly, [the other] side would not wish to have the valuation changed,
if it should be unwilling to have the valuation made less, since it
has no right either to seek or desire that, the opposite of which it
would not seek or desire if the positions were reversed.

Then, too, this question would be as follows: There can be no
question there if the surn paid for the goods is in duty bound to be
sequestrated; for the observation mentioned above, of the Privy
Council‚ leaves this sum to the vendor himself, and the same principle
applies here, because either we shall keep the amount paid‚ or the pos·
session or tenure of the goods‚ which we have, will be taken from us ’
or at least disturbed, and yet that should not be done. Therefore, we
shall hold the price just as we hold the goods‚ whose place the price
will take and in whose place it will be substituted. Either this will
be done, or the goods will not be sold, but will be left-which
should in no wisc be done—to destruction. Consequently‚ there is no
question here.

Or will there be the question of appointing new bondsmen to
pledge themselves to guard and return the sum paid? I should not
think this either, ibecause those appointed before still remain, since ¹

the reason for their final obligation remains‚ since their obligation is
not increased, and it makes no differente to them personally. Accord-
ingly, ¹‘if the security stands, even without a decree of the President,
goods of this sort may be alienated. Then, too, you may think
that the security stands if one side does not agree to this sale. In
that case the bond will not be called one that is ‘⁴ renewed.”
