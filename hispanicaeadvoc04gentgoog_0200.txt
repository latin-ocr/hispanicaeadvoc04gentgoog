174 Alberico Gentilr'

One may also maintain that the authority there of the Floren-
tine text isnot superior to that of the other texts. All the commonly
used books and the editions of Noricum, as well as the doctors‚ regu·
larly have that case “of the debtor '' suffering the creditor to go

to law about the ownership of a pledge. “Zasius boldly defends

171 both the case and the reading. Furthermore, the case furnishes an·
other reason for us, to this effect: The debtor who allows a creditor
to take legal action prejudices his ease; therefore the owner also who
allows the navigator to take legal aetion prejudices his case. The
nexus of the argument is ’ὡ that the creditor both holds possession
for the man who is in his debt, and is his agent; the navigator both
holds possession for the owner, andis his agent. ¹¹ Besides, we under·
stand that everything was pledged to the navigator as security for his
freight charges, although action was not taken against the navigator
on this score—in this case it would not have damaged the owners-,
but action was taken concerning the ownership and possession of the
property.

It may not be urged against me that the Florentine reading is
better than the rest, for even from the Florentine reading we very
often depart. kkThey say that it abounds in numberless mistakes.
Even though that edition has always been known and taken into ac·
count here, yet ordinarily the other hasbeen more approved-un·
doubtedly it has been just as highly approved. ¹¹“Each text is
good,’' says Angelus. Even Albericus does not reject the good com·
monly accepted text, although he calls the Pisan¹ better. Even Co·
mensis does not call this commonly accepted text false, that is, at
variance with the law, and not to be retained, although he would con·
sider the Pisan the most accurate. This is often the case, that diverse
and adverse readings are defended in the same passage. ¹²¹¹* Now,
Alexander did not simply reject the common reading, as he indicates.
I do not forget too the fact that the other reading has been accepted
for a long time. Consequently, it should not be rashly changed,
¹¹¹¹ as Alciatus says in another similar inquiry.

⁰⁰ Resides, whatever may be true of that reading, the principle
is commonly held that it is to a debtor's prejudice to suffer a creditor
to go to law about the ownership of a pledge. What then shall be
done in practice, if Alexander, Covarruvias, and some others argue
to the opposite effect? For this reason is not the common opinion
to be followed in practice? ¹²⁹ The common opinion ought to be fol·

172 lowed, even if the opposite opinion seem more correct. rr We shall
not depart from the common view even for Bartolus, not even on a

disputed connective, not even if six or seven hold views opposed to it,
not even if the Pope does. We shall not, even if it is not proved by
