The Pleas of a Spanish Advocato, Bk. I. 59

In this case a sale was made to Dutch enemies and to other aliens
in contravention of the laws of the Portuguese kingdom, which for·
bids commerce there with those who are not Portuguese. ¹¹² Corn·
merce with the enemy is forbidden even by the common law. This
is the common law. Let not the point of covering money into the
liscus outside of the realm be urged against us as an objection, if
confiscation should take place under a statute or a special law, lor
this point aids the Dutch in nowise. It does not aid the others, be·
cause confiscation always results from the common law, even if
the stoppage of commerce is based on a special law, for the direct
reason for confiscationis derived from the common law, which con·
hecates a thing sold in violation of the law. However, in this case
the confiscation of all this property in England is not asked for, but
we ask that what was confiscated some time ago in Brazil under the
immediate action of the law be handed over here. We ask for
property acquired in that country by the Spanish King, found here,
and here to be turned over to the Spanish King as his. In this case
there is no need of an action, as 1 have said. There is no need of
a verdict here, unless, perchance, concerning the declaration of the
loss; there is no need of an execution here, except to secure a sure 56
result. Thac matter of not confiscating outside the realm does not
concern property confiscated under the immediate action of the law.
What hasbeen confiscated cannot be confiscated again. The question
has no place where the offense has to do with a thing. Therelore
this question has no connection with ours. But suppose there is here
not a question of confiscation, but of another penalty. ³ If a claim
existe, its satisfaction is sought anywhere. Still, even if the ques·
tion should arise of the right to confiscate, because at present we are
talking not of immovable property, upon which that question turned,
but of movable property, even that question in the present instance
would in no wisc concern us. Movable property is always confiscated
even outside the realm: ⁰“ Note that the emperor confiscates ‘mov-⁴
able’ property outside of his realm, and bear this in mind. The
reason is that ‘ movable ’ property is connected with a person.” Baldus
and ”the others who follow Baldus hold that it is not bound to the
place, and therefore comes under the control of the judge who conlis-
cates it, even if it be outside of his territory. I may say also, in this con·
nection, that they add Salycetus, Alexander, Socinus, and Cotta, and
they assert that this view is the more approved one. For my own

part, ‘¹1 add to them Romanus and Brunus, cited by Natta on the
opinions of Alexander. ‘Furthermorq I mention Ruinus‚ Cephalus,
Ancharanus Regiensis, Fridericus Scotus; and the last mentioned
writer, too, develops the subject at some length, and notes by way
of distinction that the place does not determine the ownership of
