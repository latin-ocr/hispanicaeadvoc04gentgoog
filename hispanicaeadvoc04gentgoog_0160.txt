ily than judges. The reasons are common in both cases, for the
material which makes up the proofs is often lost, if it is curtailed.
¹¹¹² Now, in the matter of admitting an accusation in writing against
“ no one,” elsewhere also the canons and laws say, “in writing it
should never be received,” etc.; still the first response is more definite,
for the reason of Aretinus, the fifth argument urged against us, is in
striking opposition to this later response. Still we will reply even to
that reasoning later. ’

Now to the third point comes the reply, ¹¹ that in reality the
entire examination of witnesses in such cases has been put at the
discretion of the judge, and he ought not even to do that which the
first proposition of the argument calls for, since we see that everywhere
such an examination under the law is intrusted by the judge to others.
¹¹¹³ From this circumstance Nellos also maintains that this reasoning
about the countenance and about hesitation would hold in criminal,
not in civil actions, since in civil actions the judge can intrust the
examinatior of witnesses to another person. There are like points
too in his writings, in his treatise “On Wimesses,” where he also
supports the same position as we do in the question itself. But,
further, the second proposition of the said argument is not defensible, '
because it may chance that even a man who has written his testimony
may be agitated‚ may grow pale, may falter, when in person, in
the presence of the court, after taking an oath, he offers his docu-

132 ment to the judge. This proposition may hold when the writer
of the document is absent. All the arguments on the other side
deal with one who is absent, whether witness or prosecutor. In
other words, we are required to make an accusation in writing, al·
though we are forbidden to make it in written form [only], i.e., as
I have said, in a document, in a letter, in scaled form, ¹¹as Har-
menopulus says. l repeat this second opinion of his, which also seems
to count against us: “If anyone offer the deposition of a person in
scaled form, such testimony is no longer to be accepted.” Bothe is
also talking of an absent witness whose deposition another person pre·
sents. ¹²²¹”Testimony which is given by one who has not taken an
oath is forbidden, witnesses are those who have taken an oath, as
the canonists explain the differente between testimony (testimonia)
and witnesses (testes) ; ¹²¹¹ and the writers on civil law are entirely in
agreement with them. Now, this man who hasbeen swom also is con·
sidered our witness. Even the point mentioned above about falter-
ing would not be so strong, ⁰⁰ since often people are agitated‚ grow
pale, and do other things of this sort through weakmindedness,
etc. ⁰⁰ On the other hand, others bear themselves in this situa-
tion with boldness, with unchanged expression, and they even, though
ready in replying, at times show diffidente in speaking, tremble and
