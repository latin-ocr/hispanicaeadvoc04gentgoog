44 Atherico Gentilr'

Socinus does not successfully reply with bis distinction between an
offense which has taken place and one which has not taken place,
because after the offense has taken place, one deals also with a
benefit, that is, with the acquittal of the ollender. Now, I would
say in support of Aretinus that it would be a mockery of the laws,
if it were put in the power of a man to avoid punishment by antici·
pating his opponent in making the attack. t'So elsewhere l write
that a marriage between young people still under parental control,
consummated, but contracted without the consent of the parents,
ought to be annulled-although marriage is a thing of most beneficent
character—of course, because the children would easily protect them·
selves by this act of consummation. ¹⁸ The matter of acquittal is benefi-
cent, when there is a doubt whether an offense hasbeen committed
or not. But when it is clear that it hasbeen committed, undoubtedly
conviction is beneficent‚ since it is for the public advantage to punish
guilty people. And here let no exception be singled out of an ollense
committed at the right time, because an offense is forbidden at any
time and is punished. ”¹² And in this way punishments are beneficent.

43 Likewise‚ in reply to the dicta of Socinus, ¹¹which are also adopted by
others, l remark that we have not before us the case of an ollense
followed up, but of fear that it will be followed up. Further‚ with
Bartolus I observe: “l ask anyone, into whose hands the present dis·
cussion shall have fallen, not to make the distinction in this case a
public one for fear that au occasion for murder chance to be given,
etc.”² This distinction is under very grave suspicion and for the
reason that it requires to be kept quiet, because it gives opportunity
fornmurder. ln this way the replies to the fourth argument are of
various sorts.

The fifth argument does not embarrass us, because the people of
Lanuvium mentioned above set out with the authorization of the
state. ¹¹¹¹Therefore, they were enemies as soon as that war and
that giving of aid had been decreed. In other words, in that case
everything had been done to assume the name and the standing
of an enemy. But the Britons start out as private citizens, and they .
are not enemies unless they have become soldiers of the enemy, as
has been said. They have not yet satisfied the condition “of being
with the enemy,” and while the condition is unfulfilled itis exactly
as if they were not enemies. Similarly, the common opinion is the
same in the case of the man who hasbeen condemned and in the case
of a sentence which is pending on account of appeal. On this point
Socinus writes that the sentence passed is conditional and pending,
and “what is pending is not the same as that which is.”
