the opposing arguments mentioned above do not present any difficulty,
for they do not really present a difficulty, I reply that in my opinion
the English have the right in their favor, and that the Sardinians and
Maltese are wronging them.

Further, with reference to the other merchandise, which consti·
tutes far the largest part of the property concerned, the merchandise
outside of the contraband mentioned above, Ι think that the English
are undoubtedly right. ¹²When lawful and unlawful merchandise
belong not to the sante but to different persons, the lawful is not
confiscated on account of the unlawful, nor is the lawful confiscated
even if both go with the sarne skipper. This is the view which
Cynus, baldus, and Salycetus prefer. “This is the truth,’' says
Baldus. ⁰“lt is the truth,” Bartolus says also, and Alexander
makes the sarne remark in commenting on Bartolus, ¹’and later Fe·
lynus and others express the same opinion. qThis is undoubtedly
the common opinion in the case where owners of lawful goods have
not known about the unlawful goods. ‘Undoubtedly he did wrong in
ignorante, as Ripa writes on this very point, and he remarks that in
a doubtful case ignorante is presumed, etc. It is unreasonable to

85 think that a lawful thing should be confiscated on account of an un·
lawful one, since when things are separate and distinct the principles
applied are separate and distinct, as we find in Baldus. lt is unrea-
sonable that the hatred felt for one person should incommode an·
other, as Salycetus has it. These lines of reasoning are general and
approved everywhere. Therefore, the view would be established
also by common usage, and on this point there is a passage in Clarus.
He says that this view is the milder, and is therefore the one to be
held, and in this case Clarus is even assuming that the owner of the·
lawful goods knew about the unlawful goods. Furthermore, what
others say of the man in ignorance should not be taken of one who
does not know, but of one who is not a partner. Otherwise, that
truth, stated by Bartolus and by others, concerning lawful property
which is not to be confiscated with unlawful property will have too
wide a scope, if it applies where both were in charge of the same skip·
per. Now, Baldus, to be sure, interprete this word by writing, “ What
belongs to another is not to be confiscated, unless that other was an
accomplice in the offense.” lndeed this is the common opinion,
“that all property is confiscated, whether it belongs to the skipper
himself or to another, provided he knew and consented,¹' as Clarus
reports. It is not enough to have known, unless one shall have also
consented, ‘unless one shall have been ‘¹ acquiescent,” as it stands else·
where. ‘indeed the man who is associated with another in an of·
fense is in consequence thereof an accomplice even. Those who com·
mit a crime, and, to quote the common phrase, those who consent to
