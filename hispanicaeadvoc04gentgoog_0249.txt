CHAPTER XXIII

Of an A qr'eemenr M ade in Consequcnce of Fear and Guile

If anytbing is found to have been done, it is the presumption
that it was done voluntarily and not through lear, because otherwise
a delict would be presumed, for the reason that the person who
should use lear in accomplishing his purpose would be committing
a delict. 'This is the view, and held without qualification, too, which
Alciatus gives on other cases in dealing with the rules applying
to presumptions. However, the more difficult prool does not fall,
as it may in other cases, upon him who wishes to prove the existence
of sear in spite of that presumption ol tbe law; ior, as it is the gen·
eral custom to employ sear secretly, the easier and inferential proof
is enough, as we bave it in the same writer and on other cases. Thus
too, guile, thoughnot presumed, is proved by inferesses-¹³ as others
also have explained at length—and by circumstantial evidence. cEx·
cessive precautions prove the existence of guile, and here the precau-
tions are ol this kind. dGuile is proved by frequent efforts to per-¹
suade one; this likewise was the situation in the case of Pintus. To
persuade is more than to compel. Thus, therefore, the reply hasbeen ⁴
made that the action was the result of guile, of a iraudulent scheme,
and that a person using fraud in the way described is held for dam·
ages.

eGuile is presumed on the part ol him who bas acted through an
agent and has not taken care to see the contract. And the man who
had a transaction with Pintus did not take care to see under what
authority the latter might act. This is especially noticeable‚ since he
bad heard too that Pintus did not have the authority to transact any
business whatsoever. Let them not cast up tome the clauses of this
transaction. ‘They all vanish into thin air, if guile is found; ⁸and 222
they vanish il they are understood to have been drawn up with the
same intent with which Pintus was induced to engage in the trans-

action.
