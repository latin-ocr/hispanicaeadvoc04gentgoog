CHAPTER XIV

Os M akiny an instrument to Couer a Delu, and of
Releasiny Sureties

TO THE Most DISTINGUISHED Locuz SEDEGNUS

There is no doubt that the most illustrious ambassador may be
held to release his sureties who are soon to leave England, ‘for
184 Menochius has very recently taught that sureties who are about
to depart must be released, and he cites ten doctors who bave
taught the same doctrine, but mentions no one in opposition. But ·
the question is, whether the ambassador may be held to make an
instrument for them today or give them some other promise that
will release tbem when they depart‚ or, as the sureties demand,
within a fixed time. l should think that a request may not be made
for a hxed time, since tbis would bind the ambassador to an obliga·
tion, to which he is not bound; he is held only in the case of depar-
ture, buthe does not seem to be bound to an instrument valid for
this unsettled day of departure, for this introduces either a new
obligation or a more binding one. ln neither case is the ambassador
held to execute an instrument, bbecause obligation implico willing-
ness, not necessity, ‘and because, where the condition of the man
under obligation is made worse, he is not held to execute au instru-
ment. But it is made worse, if the obligation is made more binding.

But if the instrument is sought as a proof only, even then the ¹
ambassador is not held to execute it, since there is no danger in this
case that the proof may be lost, for the law is what binds the ambas· ’
sador, and the prool fumished hythe law, which always has a voice,
cannot be lost· The ambassador is bound hythe law to release them
when they go. Why shall the ambassador add his own bond to that
of the law? The law always speaks with a clear voice, and therefore

is no doubt that proof will be at hand, an instrument may not be asked

“ for. ‘Action may be taken in advance to make the claim in the case
clear, so that it may be admitted when the time comes. But there is

,no need ol such a declaration in this case, where the law is clear

and the voice of the ambassador quite so. ’
The opposite action to this is taken in behalf of the ambassador,

I say, in the other case, when the ambassador asks for an instrument
