CHAPTER XXVIII

Panope-Monesi Is Owed for the Turks captured by the Tuscae
on an English Ship

The Tuscana who captured their enemies‚ the Turks‚ and their
goods on the ship shall pay in lull to the Englishmen the lare which
the Turks would have paid to the English ship at the place agreed
upon; ²lor the victor takes the place ol the vanquished, and any
and every possessor is bound by an hypothecary action, and lor
passage-money everything is subject to a lien. hThe Tuscan is held
lor the whole lare, no matter what may have happened with reler-
ence to the persons and property ol the Turks‚ not as a result ol the 123
situation of our men, but as a result ol their own situation. eThe
claims upon property go with it when it changes hands. ‘¹ The victor
comes under the law that applied to the vanquished. Tell me, would
not the Tuscan be willing to accept a claim of the vanquished Turks‚
if they had had any of a like kind on the goods ol the Englishmen?
eHe would be quite willing, you may be sure. Accordingly, he
should be willing to accept the present state of allairs, when he would
have done so if the situation had been reversed. He should be pas·
sively willing now to accept what then he would have actively willed
to receive. ‘The rule is, according to nature, that a loss should
be lelt where a gain was expected. This in briei in regard to the law.
Now, ii, as the story goes, our countrymen actually had an agree·
rnent to this ellect with the Tuscana, so much the clearer and more
definite would the case for our countrymen be.

A slight addition for the end ol Chapter XXVI-Thea, too,
the great Duke‚ with that generosity of his which he promises our
countrymen unasked‚ will take into consideration the lact that our
men who were skilled in navigating the ship were taken from it and ,ἵ
others unskilled were put in charge ol its navigation. I rnean the
English ship which others not Englishmen lack the skill to navigate as
well as those who are accustomed to do so. Lack ol skill is accounted
a fault, and if there is even a slight lack of such skill, the lessee too is
held responsible. This is certain. If Ι knew the men whom the
Tuscan put in charge I would say whether they are skilled; ⁸ lor he is
skilled who has thrice acquitted himself creditably; he is thoroughly
experienced, a master, etc. One should consider the place where the
ship was lost, to see whether a skilled navigator would have lost her
