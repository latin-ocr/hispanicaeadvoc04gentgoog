CHAPTER V

Whether It Is Lawsul to Capiturehthe Enemy in the Territory of
not er

It seems lawful to capture an enemy in the territory oi another.
‘Without doubt it may be lawlul to enter another’s field for the
purpose of hunting wild beasts. Therelore, it may also be lawlul
to enter another’s territory ior the purpose oi hunting the enemy,
bfor war is a hunt, eand a territory is nothing else than a domain.
Even il a man has entered a field against the will of the owner he
takes possession olbis spoils. Suppose that the pursuit of the enemy
who is on the point oi capture has begun in a territory where cap·
ture is allowable, but that he has continued his ssight and been taken
in the territory of another? ‘¹In the case ol an offender who has
lled in this way and been captured, the legality of the capture is
maintained by Mynsingerus in the conclusione of the l'mperial Chan-
cery on the authority oi Angelus and others, ⁶ and this assertion may
be generalized in accordance with the rule that it is the lawful begin·
ning, not the unlawful end, that must be taken into consideration.

But this conclusion is false in the case oi an enemy. ‘This I
have shown in my books on war. The territory of another insures
saiety, and when territory changes, control changes, etc. Further,
Baldus, Romanus, Alexander, Jason, and Cagnolus teach that an
ostender who is taken in another’s territory, ⁸must be set free, even
if his flight began in territory where capture was allowable, inasmuch
as at the end the situation is dillerent. lCephalus says that even
a captive taken in the territory of an owner of lower rank may law·
fully be recovered from the territory of an owner oi higher rank, and
that too, because the beginning of the pursuit there was lawful.
And to this ellect he cites other doctors as well as Angelus whom
Mynsingerus mentions in support of his divergent opinion. But con·
sider further that it is ol the disturber ol the public peace

that Mynsingerus is speaking. Him it is lawful to take in another’s 19
territory, and in this case Cephalus too agrees with him. But beyond

that case the remarks of Mynsingerus do not g0, as hasbeen noted
in regard to them. iThis is what they say on' that point, and other
German writers who express similar views say that he violates an·
other’s territory who aiter beginning his pursuit lawiully makes a
capture in another’s territory. They say that he may be held for
