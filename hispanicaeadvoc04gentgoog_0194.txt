made by a notary or by an agreement. wa, in this way Ι shall
reply to other arguments also, if they are brought forward-the
present arguments 1 am bringing up against myself on my own
account-to prove ownersbip, to prove possession.

These matters I note in order that it may be clear that these
adversaries of ours are evidently bringing a false charge in daring to
offer a full and immediate proof of ownersbip and possession. And

they will not be helped by tbe common saying that things which do not
profit one, when taken singly‚ help, when they are many in number,

for if the points are many itis the rather probable that all of thern
cannot be brought in at once. bb In this matter of proving ownersbip,
and to the aforementioned argument and to others, and to this com·
mon saying Menochius replies that in a case involving much money,
like this one of ours, several presumptione are not combined to make
165 a complete proof3 that in the case of presumptione or proofs which
taken individually do not tend to establish ownersbip, and the proofs
in¹ our case do not tend to tbis effect, as he also shows, it is not
true that they may be combined to establish ownersbip. He also
says that this connection is never established when full and true
proofs are required, as full proofs are required in establishing own·
ership. ⁰⁰ In spite of the fact that Menochius elsewhere and others
teach that ownersbip is difficult to prove, and that therefore in prov·
ing it inferences and indications are accepted, this statement is not
to be applied to any inferentes whatsoever, but to inferentes which
establish a proof that is sure and approved by the law, and they
teach that itis to be applied only in certain cases, such as those which
run back into tbe past. ‘¹⁶ So Decianus also distinguishes in this con·
nection between new and old matters. ⁶² In addition 1 mention Cra·
vetta and Contardus, who teach that the proof of any ownersbip is
easy. ὅΙ mention also Corneus who says that ownersbip is not so
difficolt to prove, that proofs lacking in completeness should be ac·
cepted. There are more points to this effect, which have been set
down in writing, even in the very cases where merchants are con·
cerned, and in these cases they are said to hold. ⁸⁸ If proofs in these
cases are not dispensed with, proofs concerning the merits of the
case and concerning the deciding points are not dispensed with, ¹¹¹² and
it is clear that there are proofs concerning deciding points. Now, Ι
do not inquire further. 1 know that not very many of the points
which bave been brought forward by us in their bebalf should be urged
Ι against us by our adversaries. iiI deny that they have acquired
the ownersbip of the goods, even if bought with their own money,
even if bought under their instructions by their agent, unless also
in accordance with their instructions the goods have been handed
over to the agent, or unless he has handed them over to the mer·
