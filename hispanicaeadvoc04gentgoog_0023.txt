To thr most illustrious ond learned mon, [x]

His Lordship Scipione Gentili‚ Iurisconsult,
Counselor of the Commonwcalth of Nuremberq, most distin·
quished Predecessor, ond beloved F riend ond Colleaque,

Concerninq the Writinqs of his Brother, likewise o Man of the
greatest Renown, a Jurist of the greatest Eminence, His Lord·
ship A iberico Gentili‚ chius Professor ond Royal A dvocote, etc.

Most brilliant and splendid figure among jurists, chief glory of
this Lyceum, Scipione: when the report first came from Britain that
thy brother Alberico—that great man-had left this hagie-comit
stage of life, and that thy father, Matteo, had followed along that
road which all mortals must once tread, as well kings and the dis·
tinguishcd scions of kings, as the drcgs of the common hcrd to whom
birth hasbeen granted, I remember that thou didst seem almost over·
whelmed by the violence of thy grief and that thou didst seem to
be leading a bitter life, robbed as it were by his death of half of
thysclf-robbed of half of thy heart and lif .

This was the power of love and the force of nature to which ι
even the wise man yields obedience; his fiber is not of horn and flint, [¹¹]
and he does not war against nature, as if he were Gigas.

Now thou hast yielded enough to grief and to mourning which
has its own limits, as all things have. Now the mighty queen, reason,
comes forth, and brings the dead to life, to life, I say, through his
many great services and through his books which cover all the fields
of learning, for by his books he has gained for himself a second
life even in this world, not to speak of life in the other world, which
God gives freely to mortale, and has already given and will give
henceforth to Alberico, in addition to a crown of blessedness.

But with what praise will those learned in the law deservedly
attend thee, Gentili‚ most distinguished glory of this body, and what
thanks will they pay thee for thy deserts in bringing to light the post·
humous writings of thy brother, an eamest of which at this moment
arethe “ Spanish Pleas ” which we owe to thine industry. Pray, let
us owe to thee in the future more writings of this sort, in which the
fame of each of the Gentili flourishing beyond the grave may prove
the concord of brothers, concord which is the dcarest blessing of life. ²
