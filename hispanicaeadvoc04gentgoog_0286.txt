would not even be called a legal fiction, 00000000 for it is not indeed a
fiction, 0000 and even a legal fiction itsell is the truth. 0000 The election
was opposed, or rather the objection was made to the candidate oi
Menochius that he sullered from a certain deformity, on account ol
which under the Levitical law he could not have been chosen to the
ministry ol the altar, which Menochius‘ client desired. Menochius
says that today such regard is not paid to deformity. We hold the
same view that such great attention is not paid to periods oi time
today‚ when in the first place there are very many bachelors, and when
263 in the second place this youth could have been made a master before
reaching the periodos lite during which the statute provides that can·
didates are to be questioned on grammatical matters only. It isa
severe statute if it allows one to be admitted as a scholar of this Col·
lege 0000 only in case he can now be created a doctor under the common
law, and thus be in the College of Doctors; a man who can perform
other duties in the commonwealth itsell. But neither ought severity
to be taken lor granted nor severity in a statute, 0000 lor severity is
exacting justice, harsh, the greatest injustice, the greatest torture, etc.
Besides, has the statute thus lar been interpreted in any other

way than 1 say it ought to be interpreted? Let a case bc shown ol
the formal rejection of anyone on the ground that he has not exceeded
the seventeenth year, provided he was in the seventecnth year. lt
will be easier to point out individuale who have been admitted at an
earlier age. Let an investigation be made. 1 pass over what is very
often mentioned here, i.e.‚ 0000 that it has been wont to occur very
often at Toulouse and Avignon that an election to a college is an·
nounced owing to a bribe‚ in which case the statutes are violated, and
the great crime ol simony is committed. But the statutes are observed
most scrupulously, most strictly, to the very dotting oi the i’s and the

shall nothing be granted as a lavor to the father who makes the re-
quest, a father who has in no wise deserved ill of the Academy?

And as a lavor to the King who, lor a second time, and with a
greater right to be heard, requests to have the boy accepted, shall
not this concession be freely made? And will they not listen to justice
which 1 have shown to be clearly for the boyi ⁸⁸⁵⁸A just interpreta-
tion prevails even over an exact meaning. Ihave set forth the just
interpretation, thatin our case the year begun should be accepted
in place ol the completed year, il that is just which is in accordance
with the law, and this is the interpretation of the law, 000 Further·
more, not only the authority of the law gives words their true and
exact meaning, but this meaning should be taken on the warrant ol

264 him who fixes the law, that such and such a word should be under·
stood thus in such and such cases.
