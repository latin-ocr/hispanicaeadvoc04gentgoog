CHAPTER XVI

Of an Appeal from anln;er}10c}tory Decree, and of Revision
o t e ame

Appeal was taken when the judge had admitted certain people
who came as third parties to delay a res iudicata between others. At
the same time also petition was made to the Prince fior a revision oi
this admission. Consequently, two points must be looked into: 189
whether it is lawfiul to appeal, and whether it is lawfiul to ask for a
revision. -

Now, the first question would not be difficult, ‘since it is said to
be “quite true and an undoubted fact'' that it is lawful in an action
fior possession, as this one is, to appeal against any irreparable injury
whatsoever, done before the verdict has been given. bA thoroughly
prudent judge will decide that there is a just and reasonable cause
for admitting an appeal from an interlocutory detrec, when he sees
that a loss caused by an interlocutory decre'e cannot be repaired by
a definitive decree. This is the teaching oi Menochius, and an inter·
locutory decree which deals with the admission oi persons involves
such an injury. ‘Consequently appcal from it is allowed by Specu-
lator, ‘Johannes Andreae, Baldus in a very tull discussion, Angelus, Ἴ
Romanus, and others cited by Menochius and Contardus, and still
others, as well as by these two writers, Menochius and Contardus.
No one whom I know holds a different opinion, with the single ex·
ception of Jason, and, in the single case οἱ admitting witnesses, Ful·
gosius. Now, Jason, just as he mocks at the opinion oi Speculatus,
which cverybody accepts, so in my opinion improperly cites Ful·
gosius as opposing the others on the general principle. However,
these arethe words oi Fulgosius: ‘¹“ From an interlocutory decree
an appeal may be taken, when by it prejudice would be done which
cannot be repaired by a definitive decree, and Angelus says that
Speculator holds that it an interlocutory decree of a judge shall have
ruled that some witness ought to have been admitted, who ought not
to have been, one may appeal even under the civil law. He also
teaches that the doctrine holds asa general principle when by an in·
terlocutory decree anyone is declared to have a legal standing who
has not. But what he says about a witness does not seem to involve
an injury which may not be repaired by a definitive decree, as, ior
instance, ifi he had made a wrong decision based on the depositions
