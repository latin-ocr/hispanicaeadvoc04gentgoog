Poitiers and which, as he also says, should be followed. Gigas has
noticed that it is followed at Venice, as Decianus himself relates.

Now, in answer to Arebidiaeonus, Socinus replies that he does
not seem to stand on sure ground, if bis position be carefully ex-
amined. Tbis is true, ”for Arebidiaconus says: “If a person be
seized by a bailill outside of a graveyard or a choreb, led through a
chureh, and taken therefrom by force, the immunity of the cbureh
does not seem to be violated. See the writings of Arebidiaconus on

, Code, De aedificiis privatis, l. si quis,² in the argument against the
= first point, qu. si quis contu, and on ean. defim'nit,⁸ at the begin·
ning‚ where you notice bis hesitating words, “he seems,'’ and in
that connection you will notice that only an argument is given,
28 although it is a very good one. Another and an opposite view is given
later on, auditis supported by a two-fold argument from the canon
law itself, ¹² but we rather accept tbe opinion of the author which is

given last, oeven when be does not support it at all.

But if Arebidiaconus, upon whom all the rest depend, either
holds the opposite view or lays down no principle, of what value
will tbe names of the rest bei lA doctor, my friend, Oddus, states
that the names· of those who depended on a passage in Baldus
are of no wcight. “ ln reply,” he says, “it is enough to weigh care-
fully the dictum of Baldus, for all of them depend upon it entirely.
Now, Baldus lays down no principle, etc.” qSo also another doctor,
my friend, Clemens Nonius, in opposing Alexander and Corneus,
says that a man does not seem to make a statement who depends
upon the statement of another, if that other really makes no state·
ment. rln the same way Menoebius argues against several oppon·
ents, tbat reliance ought not to be placed on the authority of those
who have spoken without due consideration in following Speculator,
since the latter was talking, not about law, but about usage. 'He
mentions similar cases elsewhere. “⁸ We take it for granted that the
man who refers vaguely to the tcacbings of others holds opinions of
the same ebaracter as are the opinions of those who are cited.”

ult is a well-known and much-used principle that whatever
stands in the original is also implied in full in the citation. ² lt is
a well-recognized principle that the dicta of learned men are inter·
preted in accordance with the laws and authorities which they have
cited, even if their words seem to say something else. ’They would
seem to have gone astray and to make no definitive statement who
report what is not found in the original. 'Their authority is worth
nothing. At least we can say here with Socinus that all these followers

29 of Arebidiaconus reaeb no bxed conclusion, for certainly Arebidia·
conus himself reaches none. ¹¹Alciatus writes that the man who merely
states the pros and cons reaches no fixed conclusion, and in the
