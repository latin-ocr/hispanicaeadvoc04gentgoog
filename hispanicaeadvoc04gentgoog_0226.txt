Os an Action for Possession to Cover the Retention of Property; ·
οἱ Cancelinq a sequestration- οἱ a furatory Bona„
and of Acceptinq Certain Bondsmen

That ⁸one who holds possession ought not to be disturbed in his
possession, both the doctors say, and it is undoubtedly the truth.
bLikewise it is certain that disturbance results, when one cannot use
his possession freely, ‘for possession means the use of a thing. “ln
like manner they say that use is interfered with by a sequestration,
that hindrance and annoyance are caused to thc possessor, thatin
fact he is robbed in a way by sequestrationt ‘that, therefore, custody
ought not to be granted, but that bondsmen are enough to safeguard
the property, which the judgc will not bring under his control on the
pretext that there is danger of a very serious temptation, unless per·
chance proof be given of this danger. ‘Even tbe spreading abroad
of reports is disturbing in the opinion of everybody. ⁸In short, the
interdict, beginning Utrobi, which we have interposed against thern,
is granted to prevent a judicial sequestration. ²²lt is given against

one who causes a disturbance by judicial procedure3 it is given against
one who causes a disturbance when he is not in possession.

Now, our adversaries clearly do not have possession; they say
they have been robbed, ¹‘and therefore they do not bave possession.
We have established our right to possession, ¹since it is enough to
have proved the right at the time when thesuit was brought, or the
disturbance made. ¹¹¹ We did not have to furnish a regular proof either
that we do not hold possession by violence, in a secret way, or by
sufferance, ¹¹ and we are not even forced to show title for our posses·
sion. ⁰lndecd, in a doubtful case just and bona fide possession is
taken for granted. ¹’Good faith is taken for granted, at least when

198 a just title resting on purchase precedes. qGood faith is taken for
granted even wbcn a stolen article has been bought, since it is taken
for granted that the wrong decd, the act of another, was unknown.
Thereforc, since our right of possession and the disturbance caused
by our adversaries have been proved, what remains except ‘that our
adversaries should be told that they must cease annoying us both
now and in the future, and that they should be lined for the loss

caused to us by annoyance in the past?
