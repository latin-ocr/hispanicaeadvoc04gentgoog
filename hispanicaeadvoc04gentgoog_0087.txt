The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. l. 61

the words seem to give another meaning. We shall understand Baldus
and the others in such a way that they may not be inconsistent, ‘⁹ as
we commonly do in such a case in opposition to the mere sound of the
word{besides the doctrine which holds in a feudal matter is not
extended into another field, especially where the ruling may be differ·

ent, as it is here. Consequently, this argument takes this form both ·
when the question of confiscation is raised and when there would
nothe a delict connected with property.

What are the points on the other sidel Is it not evident here
that the King of Spain has confiscated this property? Is not this
the property of subjects, with reference to which the earlier opinion
ol Baldus was set down? But the Spanish law brought about the
confiscation, the Spanish law which is the same as the King. But
the Ambassador asks for the confiscation, and he is the King here
to all intents and purposes. But it is also clear that this property was
bought in a Spanish² land of Spanish subjects. ⁸⁸ Therefore, the pur·
pose of the Ambassador hasbeen well founded in saying that the
goods belong to the territory where they were situated, ¹¹¹¹ and that
the increase of anything of ours, whether of land or of animals, is
itself ours, even if we gave no thought at all to the seed. ¹³ Now,
ownership has not been transferred to the purchasers‚ because the law
·forbids commercial transactions. This opinion is held by everybody.
*¹¹ Even the seller could make good his claim, and the purchaser in
this case loses the purchase money, as in more than one passage the
ancient commentator, Andreas de Barulo, has set forth in his com-
mentary on the books of the Code.

It does not count lorche Dutch enemy, does it, that they are
within their rights in taking from the Spanish and in making the
stolen property their own? We claim that they have not acquired
ownership until the captured property has been taken within the
fortilied lines. This is proved by the clear statements of the laws,
by the harmonious views of the commentators, by the settlement ol
cases on the point at issue. Besides, from these judgments which

' count against the Dutch there followts also a general argument,
peculiarly applicable here, that if property which hasbeen almost
acquired by the Dutch is held for the Spanish in England, and if this

the property of the Dutch, assuredly, ii will be kebt lor the ySpaniard
here in England. ¹¹ All of it hasbeen confiscated and forfeited be·
cause the declaration ol ownership has not been made, or, at least,
was made falsely and amounts to nothing. Let the facts be set
