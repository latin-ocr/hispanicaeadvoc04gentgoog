210 Alberico Gentili

⁶⁶ Against this view of his, stand Castrensis, Comeus, Cravetta, Con·
tardus, Socinus, and Eugenius. Their view is the more correct, even
though Rerojus and Gratus be cited along with Baldus; for suppose
that the one question bad arisen first. ‘² Then a pronouncement might
have been made on it alone, as Ancharanus and others assert. There·
lore, Baldus should not' qualify his statement when the question of
ownership has been raised at the same time. Consequently, there is
no occasion here for admitting an appeal Now, no one shall say
that any doubtful point lies here to justify an appeal, ffsaying that
in case of doubt a nullity should be admitted and the question should
be admitted to an appeal. [They would be wrong] ¹¹ for there is no
doubt, when common opinions support the stand taken. And as to
the duty of taking an appeal on the question in case of doubt, there
is none when we have a negative rule which forbids the taking of an
appeal, just as there is a rule here that no appeal be allowed in a suit
2⁰8 for possession. ¹²¹² This is the view of Decius precisely on this point
and of Berojus also. And Decius is followed on this point by
Alciatus in his “ Replies‚” and in his “ Lectutes '’ he had said that
this same thing was conclusively proved from Panormitanus‚ although
the latter would nevertheless consider it a safer course to admit an
appeal even where there is a negative rule. Molinaeus too would
follow this procedure in his supplement to Decius. This same view,
opposed to that of Decius, is followed by Contardus, who also handles
the question, and he speaks of others besides himself in support of
the same view. However, he adds others too in support of Decius,

to wit, Daldus and Nevizanus.
fiLet us examine the statements of Contardus, who supports

at some length what 1 may call the affirmative. The reason, hesays,
why an appeal should be taken in a doubtful case is that the very
term (appellatio) carries the presumption that an appeal (appellatio)
may be introduced, and the principle applies just the same when the
taking of an appeal hasbeen duly forbidden. Appeal is a beneficent
thing, for which presumption should count more than it does for a
verdict. He goes on to pay that in a doubtful case we should have
ttlllllllllltl ‘'llldlltlgl {lllltltsttstlitellit}
here and the greater equity he calls the soundest one. He adds that
in a doubtful case we should the rather presume that the decision was
given with reference to continuous than temporary possession. So
much for Contardus,

Now we reply to the first point, that on the contrary the pre·
sumption is not made in favor of the appellant when the appeal is
interposed in violation of the rule of the law. Nor do we summon
others to our help here where Contardus himself makes this distinc-
