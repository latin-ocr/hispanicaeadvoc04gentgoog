The Pleas of a Spanish Advocato, Bk. II. 2 59

our casei Our statute ought to be interpreted, not in a metaphysical
way, but according to ordinary practice. Resides, one should regard
the fact that he is a boy who is familiar with more languages and
with more arts than another boy of his age would be. The risk of
this thing has been taken by the community more than once, even
also when he was a collector, and in point of fact a prior, in the
middle of his fourteenth year. Take the risk now, if he can do more
than others of his years. I come back to the words “to complete.”
Ignatius writes to the Trallians of the baptism of our Lord Jesus,
“when he had completed three decades,” although be was aware
of the statement ’Μ “ Jesus himself began to be about thirty years.’‘
‘¹¹‘ And the Evangelist himself says of the day of circumcision, “when
eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child,”
speaking without doubt of an eightb day not in the past, not finished.
The commentator in this connection interprete it so, that “to be
accomplished¹’ does not mean to be absolutely completed and satis-
fied, but to have come and to bave begun‚ and in this way the words,
“ to complete,” are frequently taken in the Scriptores, so that another
person would be in error in that connection in turning and distorting
the matter so as to get another meaning. But suppose the writer of
the statutos, an Archbishop, versed in the Scriptores, has followed
this practice of the Scriptures? A student of the law would have 262
interpreted that word in no other way than the law interprete it in
beneficial matters-begun instead of completed. ⁸⁸⁸⁸ We must inter·
pret words according to the setting of the speaker. Our speaker
seems to have clearly distinguished the words “to pass beyond ” ,
from our word, in writing “he who has finished the seventeenth,
and has not passed beyond the twenty-sixth.'¹ 1 could believe that
the founder would not today answer otherwise, if he were living,
since today neither so high nor so exact a number of years is taken
into consideration, and besides the successive grades are sought much
earlier and granted much more easily throughout the Academy.
lhthurthermore, it is a common rule and it is an especially
convincing inference, that that principle is understood to be extended,
which, if there had been a call for it, would have been extended.
ll Navarrus adopts this rule, and he actually follows the view men·
tioned that one born by chance elsewhere ought to be accepted, even
if the statute provides for a native. As for the others, good heavensl
how frequently do they follow it even on grounds slighter than those
which have been given by us in our case. However, here we are not
even talking of extension of application, but of the interpretation of a
word which would the more plausibly hold. lm For instance, an ex·
planation is accepted, when an extensionis not accepted, ¹¹¹¹ for an
explanation makes no change. The explanation put forward by us
