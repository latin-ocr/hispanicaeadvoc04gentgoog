cianus upholds him. Menochius also says that the man is considered
elected “by everybody, by the common consent ol everybody ‘’ who
has had cast against him only two or three votes. Do we need more
arguments against a precise, superstitious, harsh, and inflexible inter·
pretation of the statute? sustantes ought not to be interpreted
in the Judaizing manner. This is a common remark. ‘⁸ Even if the
world is quite full of these Judaizers, although they may not be jews,
still itis a shame to the world, so to speak,‘' to use the words ol
Baldus. However, if the person mentioned is thought ol as elected
“ by everybody‚ with the common consent ol everybody,” although
he had three votes against him, this young man too may be elected
who lacks months only to finish seventeen years, even ii the statute
with greater strictness should require the election ol him who has
completed the entire seventeen years “without any break whatso·
ever.'’ ³¹¹Thus the argument holds in passing from persons to
times. Do we still argue, or do we delay longer after having quoted
dear decisions in specific cases?

Now, what has been said, or can be said, in opposition lumishes
no objection. We can see that these arguments have been refuted
andare inapplicable to our inquiry. What has been said ol the
words “to be completed” is not an objection, lor the reply has been
made that the seventeenth year is understood as completed in our
inquiry, and to have completed is not to have exceeded, but something
less. ’Π “ But should one have exceeded the fourteenth year to be
able to make a will or is it enough to have completed it? ” In this
way the law interprets the words “to complete ” and the word “ be·
ginning.” ²²² Consequently, some people have been able to interpret,
even ol years entered upon, the statement which the laws make about
the age of contracting marriage, namely, that a* woman ought to have
“the tull number oi,” a man ought “ to have completed” the years
specified. ⁸⁸⁸² They are not even refuted by the lact that the words

261 “to complete '’ cannot be taken ol things entered upon, but for other
reasons. It is a beneficent thing that in that situation the year en·
tered upon should not be regarded as complete, in order that there
may be a fuller and better considered deliberation in this important
matter, and inthis grave servitude-bbbbthat is the phrase—of mar·
riage. ⁰⁰⁶⁰ The same sentiment is expressed in the case of spiritual
marriage on account of the very high condition ol religious profession.
ddddHowever, a day began is regarded as complete even in mar·
riage, as it is in the case ol a will. Some people are not troubled
either in ordinary practice if a week is lacking, for it the lack is
a slight one it may in ordinary practice be called complete. Un-
doubtedly when wisdom takes the place of age, in that case attention

, is not even paid to years. Suppose we should say the same thing in
