56 Albert'co Gentili

We have still to consider whether the merchants can recover
63 from the Spaniards the price which was paid. ¹Now, the law con·
cerning a free man bought back from the enemy is stated forus in
more than one definite enactmentr '²² as is the law conceming another
man's slave that has been bought back. Furthermore, we have like-
wise law concerning every other thing bought back from the enemy,
to the effect that the price should be restored to the buyer. But
this purchase was made from the pirates, as even the pirates them·
'selves testify, and the marks of the former owners, still to be seen
on the merchandise, strengthen this testimony. ¹¹ These witnesses are
believed, provided the action is a civil one; and without reserve, when
the action is not against confederates in the crime. Now, who does
not know that the marks of earlier owners are regularly erased by
the later? ⁰But these undisturbed marks show that the owners
were no others than those who really were such. ¹’Therefore, here,
too, comes into play the clear interpretation of the law regarding
merchandise, for the merchandise [in this case] with its marks still
bears witness to its owners, and, consequently, should be restored
without payment, even by a bona fide possessor.

qHe who buys my property of a thiel does not manage my
business to advantage, since 1 might have claimed my property with·
out paying anything, as Menochius says somewhere. ¹N0w, the
same writer makes a mistake somewhere else in claiming that a buyer
of good circumstances and reputation recovers the price paid; since
bona fides would save him from the presumption of guilt, but not
from loss, if the bona fide possessor makes restoration without re·
compense.

Welll There would not be a case here of purchase from a
thief, but rather from pirates of a foreign nation, 'in which case
the laws and the doctore maintain that the price paid must be re-
turned. But Ι shall reply-if that objection is made-that the Eng-
lish pirate does not come from a nation foreign to Spain. tIf foreign
nations are such as had the right of postliminium between them·
selves and the Roman people, then such natione are enemies. Now,
between the Spanish and the English postliminium would not obtain

64 at present, since the former retain their freedom and ownership of
their property in our country exactly as they do at home, and the
same is true of us in their country. Foreign nations would be those
with whom we have no friendship, and between whom, therefore, and
us, postliminium would obtain; ²¹ as another law has it, and as I have
explained elsewhere.
