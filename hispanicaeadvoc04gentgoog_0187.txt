The Pleas of a Spanisls Advocan, Bk. II. 161

cussion, running through four long chapters, he has not advised
us of one point especially to be noticed.

Indeed, not only Innocent, but also Hostiensis and Ancharanus
and others teach, and in fact without hesitation, that presumption of
bad faith, which hinders the admission of an exception, will not hinder
it if the proof on which an exception is based be offered at once,
and that this proof in such a case should be admitted, or an appeal
will be taken from the failure to admit it. ¹² Oilering proof at once
eliminates “ afl '' presumption of malicious action, as the common view
runs. ³‘What is offered at once leads to a departure from the rules
of law, as many other writers teach at great length. But it is neces·
sary to notice that ³ these people are plaintifis who corneto hinder the
execution of a sentence pronounced in a suit between others. There·
fore it would not follow at all that an action also for delaying execu-
tion should be admitted, simply because an exception is admitted for
delaying execution, although an action which does not delay exe-
cution is admitted more readily than an exception which delays an
execution or a sentence. But innocent and the others are talking of an
exception which would not necessarily have to be approved at once; of
an exception in the case of an agreement, 1 say, not to make a claim, or
in a case of money not paid out. Itis not the practice to bring such
exceptions to oppose an execution. Resides, they speak now and then
of a quasi execution, not of an execution in the strict sense of the
term. The title upon which they are speaking, the laws cited by
them, show this. Thus they add nothing in support of Panormi-
tanus on the present point. ln fact, Covarruvias himself takes ²158
firm stand on the side of Panormitanus only in case immediate and
full proof be olicred in these circumstances. Just as Felynus also
writes that perchance the dictum of Panormitanus would hold “on
account of his authority,'’ if the proof offered were also full. Here I
observe that Felynus still hesitates and makes this concession only to
the authority of the man. Still, after putting before us this view
of F elynus and Covarruvias, we reply that in this case it would not
apply, because a full proof cannot be given at once. 'Furthermore
an execution, and this doctrine other writers teach, is not obstructed,
if the proofs are not ready and complete, but require more careful
investigation. In this case there cannot be a full and immediate proof
of ownership and possession on the part of this third adversary of
ours, “for in examinations involving an execution the procedure is
summary, and therefore exceptions calling for a somewhat more
careful inquiry are not admitted.

What will the offering of immediate proof accomplish, if an
immediate proof cannot be given? bb When there is a presumption
that immediate proofs are offered in bad faith and with evil intent,
