CHAPTER X

Of Marias, the Letters of Machares, and Other Documents from
the Collectors of Reuenue,· aad of Proof of Owner-
ship and Possession

Brands, 'they call them marks (marchae), stamped on bundles
audon chests of merchandise do not furnish full proof of the owner·
ship of the merchandise3 they furnish a presumptive and unreliable
proof, as Straccha well puts it, and on this point Menochius and the
others teach the same doctrine. Eut even before Straccha others
have taught this, so that undoubtedly tbis is the common view.
b“ The letters of merchants in accordante with usage are said to
have tbe force of public recorda, and are accepted by everybody.”
eThis is true, too, of the documents from the collectors of revenue,
dbut these letters, to be used as proof, must be acknowledged.
However, it is an accepted principle that letters not acknowledged are
certified by a comparison [sc. with other letters where the writer is
known], and the same practice would hold for account-books.
eIn the case of receipts the principle would not be the same, unless
the said receipt, which has not been acknowledged‚ has the signatore
of three witnesses; with another receipt it is not possible to secure
a comparison. And the reason for the differente is that the party
interested in the case of a receipt ought to take the consequences upon
himself if the business was not carried out in due form. On these
points Straccha holds the same opinion, and concerning the comparison
of the letters he also mentions something else to the same effect,
which I do not set down. ‘Other writers too remark in the same
way on the difficulty of proving a private document, even a docu-
ment between merchants. All these points I note against the Dutch
in this case, who wish to oller a full and immediate proof of their
ownership and of their possession by those processes which are unre-

163 liable and call for a somewhat careful investigation. Here l cried
out in a manner not mine, but that of pettifoggers.

⁸ It is more difficult to acquire possession than ownership, and
hownership, even of personal property, as Purpuratus says, is very
difficolt to prove, and, ias Purpuratus and others remark, almost
impossible. ¹‘Various things are needed for the proof, namely, of
ownership. ¹That the transfer has taken place must especially be

established, even to the extent of a transfer of possession, ¹¹¹ and al-
