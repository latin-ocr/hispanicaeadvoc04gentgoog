CHAPT ER XXVII

Of o Certain Exception against Execution

The agent's negligente-I am putting it mildly-led to such a
decree being interposed as would never have been interposed if the
agent had consulted the advocates. And yet his Worship, the judge,
might have listened to what this same agent was bringing forward
and was about to show to prevent the issuing of that decree. The
decree is null and void for various reasons, and is certainly one from
which a person would be entirely justified in appealing, most certainly

one which his worship, the judge, can deservedly recall, as Doctor
Floyd, the advocate, will set forth.

1 shall bring forward this point, that the case of more persons
is at stake here and of many more borres of sugar. Then neither
should these eight boxes be returned to those who are asserted to be
the owners, unless other owners of the remaining boxes of sugat, many
more in number, have also been heard, and unless the whole case be
defined. Suppose his Worship, the judge, has decided that those eight 23⁰
boxes belong to the claimants and suppose that they do so belong,
will he decide that they should be straightway returned to these sanie
parties? What, therefore, will become o'f the expenditure incurred ’
by his Lordship, the ambassador, in this suit? What if the expendi·
ture is equal to the value of all the merchandisei What if it is
more? Or are not such cases of very frequent occurrence in law·
suits? If the expenditure is so great, the ambassador has at least
managed the aliair successfully in reseuing the merchandise from the
enemy. The verselets of Martial apply here: “The judge makes
application and so does the advocate; my view, Sextus, is that you
should pay your creditor.” For there are two species of gain from
an enemy; the one complete, when we disadvantage him and advan-
tage ourselves; the other half-complete, when we only disadvantage
him. Let this owner of the eight chests seek an account of those
expenses from his Lordship, the ambassador, and he shall receive it
when there is need, when the other owners of the remaining chests
are present.

The illustrious ambassador does not consider it just, and it is
not just, that that one owner of a few miserable boxes should separate
himself and his little bit from the rest; for if the forces of all are
united, it will be easier to oller resistance to the freebooters who
