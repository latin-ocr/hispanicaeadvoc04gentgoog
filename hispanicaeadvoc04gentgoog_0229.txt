The Pleas of a Spanislr Adriocate, Bk. II. 203

upright life, be of established repute, be not under suspicion, and do
not suffer from a reputation for untrustworthiness.

But if the practice of the tribunal before which we stand be
urged against us, then we will say that the practice, which has op·
posed and stood in the way of such a bond as we have asked to
have received, ought to be shown. lt will in no wise be to the
point that this bond has never been given or received, q, for a law
is not nullified by the failure to apply it, but by the application of
the opposite principle. Perhaps there has not been an opportunity
to ask for the admission of such a bond. Perhaps there has not been 201
a reason for admitting it. Let our adversaries prove that a request
forits acceptante in a case like this one of ours has been made, and
that the request has been rejected, and not once merely.

¹¹ Meanwhile, this principle of law is undoubtedly correct, that
the judge will decide from the evidence and the presumptione whether
an oath should be tendered to the effect that bondsmen are not to
be found, as Socinus writes. He also cites baldus, Angelus, and
Oldradus in support of this opinion.

Furthermore, I say that there is evidence and that there are
presumptione in this case to persuade a judge that the oath should
be tendered. The very dignity of the person concemed, ⁸¹ which is
regularly considered very carefully in receiving any oath, leads to this
decision. ttMany writers in harmony with the laws observe that
illustrious rnen are not compelled to furnish a bondsman to satisfy a
judgment, but that dependence is placed on their juratory bond.
¹¹¹¹ An ambassador, the ambassador of a great King in particular, is ,
not considered a person under suspicion, and therefore dependence is
placed on his juratory bond, and this point many others note in
explicit cases. '

The very situation of a foreigner, which usually prevents him
from finding bondsmen without difficulty, leads to the same decision
in this case, '⁰‘ as the doctore illustrate in the case of a foreigner, And
we say “ without difficulty,” for the law puts it in this way, ‘⁴ if a bond
shall have been necessary, and the defendant cannot fumish it without
difficulty,'' etc, and on the same law Jason observes, “note that well·
known expression that we are said to be able to do that which we

- can do without difficulty and conveniently‚'’ etc. This is enough for
the decision of the judge, yywhich is determined without doubt by
judicial presumptione, by the purpose of the law, and by a sense of
equity. ²¹ lt is at the discretion of the judge to decide what can be
done without difficulty, ⁸⁸⁸ and because it is a general principle that
bondsmen are not found “without difficulty‚’' that conclusion will
surely be held in the case of a foreigner, and will be the decision of
the judge. tthherefore, without doubt, as the accepted rule runs,
