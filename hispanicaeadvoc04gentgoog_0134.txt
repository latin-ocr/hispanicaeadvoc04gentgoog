CHAPT ER XXIII
W bether the Parthasers of Plaudet May keep lt lor Thcmselves

The English merchants would reluse on any condition to restore
to the former owners the captured property they have bought. Ob·
serve that they bought it at Tunis, and in Tunis it is not the
law that buying even from pirates themselves is forbidden. But
now, il the law or custom of Tunis, whichever you call it, did give
judgment in keeping with the desire ol these merchants, who can doubt
that here too the same judgment would have to be given? ¹In con·
sidering the details and merits of a case, according to the common
and universal view, the place where the transaction occurred is al·
ways taken into consideration. But these merchants bought from

106 the highest Tunisian officer‚ who had, moreover, the administration
ol the main lisois. Accordingly at Tunis they would have been sale,
and accordingly they would be saie everywhere. ''l-Ie is at once sale
who buys from the fiscus of any prince whatsoever, according to
the more commonly accepted view3 οοτ, whatever the law may be,
it is certain that this is the actual practice, and such actual practice is
regarded as law. Nor do princes sulier their authority to be ques·
tioned. <¹1 do not dare, says Baldus in this connection, to assume a
lordly air and speak against the power of princes. I am not the
man to desire, says he, “to re·spade ” the world. Now, too, some
Englishman may say to me: “ Ii the merchants had bought these
wares in the open market of England, would they have had to make
restitution to the owners, whether they were Venetians or English·
men or others? ’⁹ ‘The law of England, as Ι hear it, says no. Why
do Ι say the law of England? Elsewhege, too, Ι doubt not, the law is
to this ellect. ‘It is at Padua. Whatl do we say with certain men that
the law is not valid?

Fools though we be, we know ⁸ that actual practice, even though
not established in law, is regarded exactly like law. ¹¹The custom of
a place makes lawlul the contract which would otherwise be unlawful.
iThat sort of contractis legal which is frequently used in a district
by good men and lawlul merchants. Why then, pray‚ shall they
restore these wares bought from the Turkish fiscus?

[My opponents] will say ¹¹ that Ι said in another case with ref·
erence to the fiscus of the King ol Barbary, that only where the fiscus

ol one’s own prince is involved does that legal principle, the law
