10a Translator's Prefatory Remarlcs

means Digest‚ book 49, title 15, law 19, paragraph 3.ι 19 Gentili
there are three headings regularly. Of these the main division stands
at the end of the citation, the subdivision next below it at the begin·
ning, and the smallest subdivision m the middle. Thus the reference
to the Digest Just given appears in Gentili (Ι. ch. 1 .²'a) m thef orm
l. 19. ἓ. 3. de capt From the mdex which rs prefixed to the texts of
Mommsen and Krueger de capt. can be identified as D. 49, 15 and
we at once have the complete citation D. 49, 15, 19, 3. Books 30, 31,
and 32 of the Digest are citedde 199. 9, 19 199. 2, and de 199. 3
respectively, so that l. 41. ἓ. 2. 919199. 1 (I.ch.1.c) means D. 39, 41, a.
Occasionally a law is cited not by its number, but by its first word.
Thus 1. cotem. D. de publican. (Advocatio I.xx.b) = D. 30, 4, 11.
ln a few cases the Digestis cited by the symbol 11, as in the Advocatio
ll.xVI11.lclc where i. injuriarum. 1. 9. li. de injur. = D. 47, 10, 13, 1.
The part of a law which precedes the numbered paragraphs is re·
ferred to as principium, and the last law under a title as lex ultima.
Examples are seen in the Advocatio I.1.b where the citationis i. ς
princ. de capt. and in the Advocatio Il. xxV. l where the reference 1.
uit. dere jud. is to D. 42, 1, 64. References to the Justinian Code
and to the other parts of the Civil Law are drawn up in a similar way.
For instance, (Advocatio I. v11. ll.) 1. 6. C. de aedis. pri. = C. 8, 10,
6; (Advocatio l. xv. a) 1. omnes. C. de quad. praes. = C. 7, 37, 2;
(Advocatio l. xx. b) 1. 2. 4. ult. C. de commen. = C. 4, 63, 2, 4,
and 6. The Novels in Gentili are called Anthenticae.

The Canon Law, it will be remembered, is represented by the
Decret'um of Gratian and by the collectione made since the twelfth
century. The Decretum Gratiani falls into three parts. Part l is
dividcd into 101 distinctiones, which in turn are subdivided into
canones. Part Il is dividcd into 36 causae, subdivided into quae·
stiones. Part 111 is dividcd into 5 distinctiones, subdivided into
canones.

The material which has been brought together since the twelfth
century consists of the following parts: Decretaies D. Greaorii
Papae IX, dividcd into tituli, subdivided into capituia; Liber Sextus
’ Decretalium D. Bonifacii Papae VIII, dividcd into tituli, subdivided
into capitula,· Clementis Papae V Constitutiones, dividcd into tituli,
subdivided into capitula, and finally the Extravapantes, dividcd into
tituli, subdivided into capitulo.
