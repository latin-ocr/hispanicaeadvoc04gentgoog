says Hostiensis; witnesses from a long distance, and those who are
not near the court, says 'Oldradus, and with these writers the other
doctors agree. Here, too, the judge would have no discretion in
waiting for witnesses and prools from a long distance, however
thoroughly prepared they might be. mA prooi is not immediate
where a person has to set forth the right oi one who gives and the
nature oi the thing given, when something has to be proved in the
domain of law, or something in the realm oi fact: when something
has to be gathered hythe interpretation oi words. ¹¹ Minuteness in
the way oi fact or ol law requires a somewbat careful investigation.
[A proof is not immediate] when the question of law or of fact in-
volved is not easy; when arguments do not agreer when the doctors
do not. ⁰The documents themselves which are said to constitute an
approved prooh if they call for some proof from outside, are not said
to furnish a proof at once, provided one has to debate the documents,
provided it is necessary to examine the witnesses. There are other
points which the doctors usually teach.

All these points count against the Dutch, who oller questionable
witnesses and documents, and through these witnesses and documents

161 they submit what they consider immediate proof. A prooi is not

immediate when one must debate it; in this case the Dutch will have
a very protracted debate. They wish to prove that the goods were
bought forchem in Brazil, were transported to them, were turned
over to them. And here they submit letters from Brazil, witnesses,
documents, and marks. But we shall have to investigate everything,
and examine the witnesses, and look into the validity oi everything.
And can everything be done at once? Absurdl Or they will say
that it can, for the reason that it would be enough if everything
would apparently be done. ¹³Indced, they teach and assert that we
must observe with great care that a third party, when he is to show
that his interest is'involved in staying an execution, satishes the situa-
tion in doing it in some circumstances (when there is no damage or
slight damage involved) by taking an oath3 he satisfies the situation
in other cases by oliering proof not very exact, and not necessarily
very conclusive, but only of a prima [acie sort; thatin a summary in·
quiry like this one the rejection either of witnesses or of evidence would
not be allowed.

qStill to these points Ι make the reply that in ecclesiastical
matters they hold and are taught; that they do not hold in secular and
civil cases; ‘that besides the doctrine is, I say, that this prima facie
evidence ought to be halt complete; nay, even complete, according to
some writers. ln this case, at least, complete proof is required of the
Dutch, since there isa serious presumption oi their bad saith. Here ,
a necessarily conclusive proof is required, since the question in dispute
