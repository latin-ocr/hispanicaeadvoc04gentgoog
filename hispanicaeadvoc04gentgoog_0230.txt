204 'Alberico Gentili

if he swears that he does not think that, since he is a foreigner, he can
find bondsmen, this fact would be proved in this iashion.

202 Consequently, there will have been the more reason ior this
bond, inasmuch as bondsmen who could be found for the party con·
cerned have been ollered, ior it is evident that he does not hesitate
to give the bondsmen whom he can lind. ‘⁶‘ “ Forbearance and con·

cession in the case ol difficult acts is not difficult,'' is the dictum, even

provided bondsmen are not found. But if these bondsmen are not
accepted, who are said to have been accepted in other even more

serious cases, ddcland if it is not taken ior granted today that they

are weak, andis in fact they are approved as suitable by several
highly approved persons, andis even there be a suitable guarantee
oi their suitability; surely it is the judge himself who is now acting
to prevent the party from having bondsmen. *A bond is sufficient
which satisfies the law and the man, or the law at least. “fThat
person is a suitable bondsman who possessas a good deal even ol per·
sonal property, or has several debtors. Resides, those who are will·
ing to guarantee the suitability oi the bondsmen have real property
also. No bondis suitable, ii this one is not. Ii a party ought to be
accepted on a simple juratory bond, why not on this one, when the
party will swear that he cannot provide otherwise, that he cannot
give other bondsmen? ωΑ wrong will be dona to the party and
to the bondsmen if suitable bondsmen are not accepted.
