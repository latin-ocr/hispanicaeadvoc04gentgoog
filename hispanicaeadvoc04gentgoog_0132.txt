106 Alberico Gentili

the Roman people and strange peoples, and with reference to thern,
he also cites the law mentioned above, and among thern he refers
even to those with whom we are at peace and even to those with whom
we have a treaty. tAnd under the law there are other foreigners
who are subjects-to use the Virgilian expression-“ whosoever are
obedient to our sceptre.” ⁰ Under the law, the people are foreigners
who belong to another province, even if they are not under a dillerent
ruler. Thus, the ancient translator of the Novella renders α’λλοδαπὴν
by terra extranea (strange land). hatorano'e means a man sprung
from another soil; he is of foreign extraction with respect to the
native. Consequently, to put it brielly, the meaning of this word
would be double, and under both meanings the Venetian may be
thought of as a foreigner to the Englishman. He would be, 1 say, a

104 foreigner as well as a stranger. Indeed‚ he seems more of a foreigner¹
than of a stranger, ¹ for property can be left by will to a stranger,
but not to a foreigner. Α foreigner is a resident alien, not a citizen.
The reasoning of Budaeus does not influente me, since it rests ona false
foundation, arguing as he does that we understand under foreign
nations those with whom we have the right of postliminium, not other
peoples under a foreign rule. ln point of fact, all these people are
foreigners, yalthough postliminium does not exist with all of thern.
Postliminium exists with those foreigners with whom we are not on
friendly relations, as I have set forth elsewhere. Consequently, the
above mentioned law will have a consistent meaning, provided, at
least, independent allies are foreigners in our eyes, and yet do not
hold such a position that we may have postliminium with thern. so
the Venetiam, as I have said, are foreigners in their relations to
the English. lffiow, because Englishmen have bought up the prop·
erty in this case from Englishmen, it will not injure them in the
suit, if it would not injure a Venetian who in like circumstances had
bought it from Englishmen, and it would be enough that the pirates
are foreigners to the Venetian who was robbed, even if they were not
foreigners to those who bought back the property. It is absurd to
hold an Englishman more strictly than a Venetian in his dealings with
aVenetian. The law thinks of the nation of the robbers as foreign,
not from the point of view of him who pays the ransom, since it does
not mention him till later, but from the point of view of the party
from whom the woman had been stolen, that is, the lisois. But in
reality the English have bought the property back from a foreign
source, from the Tunisian prefect.

'Again, their case is not prejudiced by the fact that, as another
law remarks, one may say that it is unfair not to be willing to restore
stolen property until the amount given for it has been paid over by
the owners, for this law does not apply when a thing has been bought
