Tiar Property Sure to Be Taken Is Not Held As Taken and
Aequired by the Enemy

Yet if property taken, but not brought within fortlhed lines, is
regarded as not taken, and il we do not think of itas acquired by

the enemy, ‘why is it that Cephalus expresses the opinion that things
not captured but to be regarded as sure ol capture seem to be the
property os the enemy. “I think there is no doubt,” he says, “that
things captured by the enemy become at once the property ol those
who have first captured them. But the whole difficulty seems to lie
in the way in which the words ‘to capture’ are taken, and, there·
lore, in deciding when we may regard the thing as captured in such
a way that it becomes the property ol the captor. But I think that
a thing is called captured when it cannot escape capture.’' Con·
sequently, he concludes in the case before him that the pirates put
to flight by the Maltese triremes, and so hard pressed withal that
they were bound to fall into the hands of the Maltese, inasmuch
as they were deprived of all hope of escape, were cast on the island
of Corsica, and taken by the 'Corsicana ought to be turned over to
the Maltese, or that at least the Corsicans are held for damages
and recompense, since it was they who kept the Maltese from attain-
ing the object ol their efforts and their reward.

'’Alciatus also holds the same view ln the case of wild beasts
which have no chance to escape. Ludovicus Molina agrees. He 15
goes into the matter more fully, to the ellect that, although owner-
ship and possession are acquired by the captor, when the wounds
inflicted by another person are not enough to lead to capture, still, '
if those wounds should make it possible lor the beasts to be cap·
tured by another, undoubtedly the man inflicting the wounds would
have a claim according to the character ol the given case,
and would have some profit himself from the captured animala and
some claim upon thern. eI have replled to this opinion ol Cephalus
in the books “ Concerning Roman Arms,” and there l have elabo-
rated the principle and developed it more fully. At that time I
declared unacceptable the opinion of Trebatius, that awild beast about
to be captured is regarded as captured,d and others follow me here.
eThe principle embodied in the dillerent rule once accepted would
not stand in the way since a little thing could intervene to prevent cap·
