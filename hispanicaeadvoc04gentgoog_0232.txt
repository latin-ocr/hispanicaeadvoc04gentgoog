CHAPTER XVIII

On Not Appeaiinq from a Decision Gioen in a Suis sor Possession

Every 'suit for possession relates to the moment, that is, it
203 deals with a temporary state of affairs. Every interdict‚ every aetion

for possession is said to relate to the moment. This is the view of
Cujacius and others, although certain authorities, bas Menochius
reports, maintain that only that suit for possession which is briefest
and out of the ordinary should properly be called “momentary.”
And yet the common interpretation of the word (momentarius) as
“soon recoverable in another court ” excludes no suit for possession,
and Cynus in treating of the means for retaining or acquiring posses·
sion says that there is no doubt on this point. And it is not doubtful
here if we are willing to follow the most commonly accepted view.
The difficult question follows, whether an appeal should be
denied even so far as it relates to devolution‚ cfor Bartolus seems
to deny the correctness of the refusal, and with him are many others
who maintain there is devolution. And this opinion, as they say, is
held in Spain, France, and Germany, and it was always observed in
the Council of Naples, and it is more commonly held, etc. And yet
there are many who testify that the contrary is the common view,
or rather the more common, and indeed they show this by citing very
many authorities. dThe truer, more widely held view, the view
more accepted in the practice of the Curiae is that it does not de·
volve. This is the view of Bastulus too in his passage [on the sub·
ject] and he does not take a diflerent view in any other passage,
no matter what may be believed of him to the contrary, as Contardus
writes. This was the view of all the ancients and the commentators
before Bastulus: ‘and concerning their predminent authority there is
nothing for me to say, because everyone knows they are above the au·
thority of Bartolus. But then, too, many more even afterwards took
their stand against that view which is called the view of Bartolus;
for instance, Baldus, Salycetus, Fulgosius, Consanus, Romanus, lmola,
Castrensis, Jason, Decius, and others. Of them Contardus makes
the same statement and he speaks also of the shifting about on the
part of others who at one time appeared to accept the opinion of
Bartolus just mentioned. ‘Thus since it is a question of fact, as to
what the common view is, ⁸and since we do not believe him who
204 talks of the common view but rather him who shows what is the
