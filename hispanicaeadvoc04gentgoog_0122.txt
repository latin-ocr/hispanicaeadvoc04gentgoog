law of nations, for the law of nations punishes oflenses only when
they have been brought to completion. ,q Now, when an offense, not
brought to completion, is viewed, in the light of a completed fact,
the action does not follow nature, which is opposed to it, but it fol·
lows a legal fiction which involves, so to speak, a certain inaccuracy.
‘¹ Consequently, the law of nature does not allow the punishment of
death to be imposed for inflicting a wound from which death does
not follow, and if it is imposed, it would be an affront, as it were,
to the law of nations, as Alexander puts it. Even in the case of the
Hanseatic peoples, which I mentioned above, they had received a
warning in advance with the reasons stated, and they were only
asked to give up their trade for a time. In this case, the English
would give it up forever in consequence of the war between the
Spaniards and the Turks which is evidently going on forever. Even
those steps were taken only with reference to articles useful in war;
here in our question all the goods are involved.

Now, concerning the document which contains the treaty of
peace with the Spaniard, we reply that the Turks are not to be un·
derstood there under the head of enemies, although reference was
made to enemies “ of any kind whatsoever,” for what the kinds of ene· ·
mies mentioned there are, is explained in the very same document:
“As well those who invade the realms of the other, as those who
withdraw from the sovereignty of the other.” The treaty does not
speak of the situation which would arise when the other prince
should invade the reahns of a third sovereign or wage an oflensive
war. It was wise not to link defense, which as a rule is justifiable
and beneficent, with offense, which is frequently unjust and more

93 frequently still maleficent. It was wise also not to leave it in the
power of the other by waging war to dis'turb commerce, which is a
most beneficent thing. Now, the Turks are not at present waging war
against the Spaniards. The treaty does not apply to the Turks, I say,
although the Spaniards may seem to be perpetual enemies of the Turks.
⁸¹ They are not, properly speaking, “these enemies '⁹ with whom there
is no war and against whom war has not been decreed, although
there may be some enemy rights in relations with them. ‘³ Not that
which has aptness for being of a certain character, is properly said to
be of such a character, but that which is actually of that character.
Now, the Spaniards are not actually enemiesof the Turks at the
present time. ”¹¹ This word, which hasbeen applied in the light of
actuality to one, ought not be taken in the light of aptitude in the
case of the other, and should be thought of as applied improperly. But
the word “ enemies ’³ put here in the treaty clearly marks enemies in

the light of actuality, “ invading '' the realms of the second party to
ι the treaty, ‘⁸ withdrawing ’‘ from the sovereignty of either one.
