there with impunity, which would be correct too in the light ol what
has just been said, even though Clarus may not regard it as correct.
Consequently he does not accept the view ol Bartolus, who says
vehat a thiel found here with stolen property taken in thelt in
another place may be punished even here, for, just as with a change
oi owners added to the continuous stealing a new action for thelt is
taken to inllict punishment upon the guilty party, so with a change of
territory and jurisdiction a new accusation would be made to secure
the protection of the state.

That the opinion of Bartolus is accepted by the assessors as
useful to the commonwealth and in accordance with the Gospel;
that it is put in practice throughout the world; that it has led to the
hanging ol thousands ol men; that it is approved by the council ol
Naples; that it is a common doctrine: and other consideratione have
been reported in Clarus and corroborated in the additions made to
Clarus, qwhatever many, without cause, against the public weal and
the commonly accepted view, may think and say to the contrary.

Still it is not necessary bere to argue about this view, for all
the authorities think this; that, let the situation regarding punishment
to be inflicted on a thiel be what it may in a new territory, still ‘if
in the new territory the act continues, there would also be an
ollense committed against the new jurisdiction. This present ques·

24 tion has to do with a case, where, although the original actis past
and gone, the action still continues, because by this route through
the English Sea and through a new jurisdiction force is being con·
tinued, force, which it was lawlul to begin elsewhere, is exercised here
unlawfully. He holds by force who continues in possession by the use
of force as well as he who has gained possession by the use ol lorce.
The Dutch should give up all use of force here and the goods ol the
lS‘panibardfs which are still free should not be taken away from them
ere y orce.

·Even in the discussion mentioned above those who oppose
Bartolus admit that a thiel should be sent back to the place where
the oflensa was committed: further, that the property should be
taken from him and restored to the owner. To these opinions we
also give assent here. The reasoning of these men too makes it appear
that a strange territory does not protect theses, etc. tCastrensis
well says that a man who hasbeen robbed would have ground lor
action against the owner of the place which received the thiel. *¹ Now
1 cite Imola liter'ally, who has replied to this ellect and says it is
‘⁴ certain ” that it is not lawful to conduct a captive through an·
other’s territory, and indeed this conclusion of his is general, although
the particular case was before him ol one who had been unjustly
seized and was besides a native of the territory. *And Bellus too
