ol witnesses.'' Thus Fulgosius expresses himself in the single case
190 oi witnesses, and even in that case he does not wisely depart from
the common opinion, since (‘as Bartolus and Baldus explicitly

respond) the admission of witnesses always creates a certain preju-
dice. ‘Furthermore even from the slightest injury one may appeal.
‘An appeal is taken from an interlocutory decree, “the proof ol
which can bring prejudice or the injury from which cannot be done
away with or repaired in an appeal from a definitive decree,'' says
Romanus. Baldus in addition notes several cases of appeal which
are lawiul in this connection: when the interlocutory decree brings
an execution with it; when it excludes proof ; when it changes a benefic.
These cases fit our situation very well, since to our detriment the
execution ol the judgment which has begun is stopped by the admis-
sion mentioned; we also are prevented from proving that they are
not third parties. But I hold that an irreparable injury results from
this admission, and ironr any other admission oi persons, hbecause,
as Baldus shows, when once admitted, they can never be rejected
again, either in the hearing ol an appeal or in an action for owner-
ship. Thus it would not oppose my argument, if anyone should allege
ithat an interlocutory decree may be recalled by the judge to whom
appeal has been taken from the definitive decree, because the power
to recall all interlocutory decrees is reposed in him. There is no
difficulty in this first question, where the opinions are common and the
reasons clear.
ln the other question several points create a difficulty, ¹⁸ although
a revision is called an appeal oi a certain kind, and ought to be con·
sidered in the nature ol an appeal. In the first place, a difficulty
arises,‘¹ because while a suit is pending a petition for a review would
not be lawlul, andan interlocutory decree does not interrupt a suit,
nor does a suit cease to pend in consequence of an appeal-at least
not in consequence ol an appeal from an interlocutory decree, ¹¹² what·
ever may be true to the contrary in the case of a definitive decree.
The laws are clear: “To petition while the case is pending is not .
191 lawlul, unless the publication either oi the proceedings between the
parties or of the decision be denied.” Here, then, two cases only
are excepted, and ours is not one oi them. Further: “He who has
failed to make a lawlul appeal must forever keep silence, nor ought
he impudently to ask aid oi us by a petition, etc.” Secondly, where
there would exist the ordinary remedy oi an appeal, the extraordi-
nary remedy of a petition would not hold. This is also the general
rule, and here there is a place undoubtedly ior an appeal, as Ι have
said, and it is not lawiul to neglect it, as we have heard. ”A peti·
tion is never admitted where an application can be made. This is
the teaching ol the doctors. ⁰The third point is that a review would
