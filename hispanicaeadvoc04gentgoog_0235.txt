time), we should have regard for the decision which, as ours did,
suspende judgment in the suit lor ownership.

Again, our opponents read us a different decision [on the point]
whether, where questions are entangled, appeal should be taken from
the whole decision‚ that is, from that part of it as well which bears
on the suit lor possession-I mean where the questions are entangled
in the sense that they are here, or where they may be so called by
equivocation. ¹¹ Appeal is taken always from the part ol the decision
that touches the question of ownership, not from that part which
touches the question ol possession, as my learned authority explains
here with great learning and at great length. *This is the view of
it taken by Menochius in cases where the two questions can be
separated, because in such cases the uselul cannot be vitiated by the
useless; and, consequently, as Cynus says, no change with reference to
a suit for possession is ever found. So much for these cases.

But my opponents will lend ear to another who says that the
decisionis clearly unjust, ythat one may appeal from such a decision,
because an evident injustice is like a nullity. Then, too, they speak
of a nullity, ‘and ol a nullity too one may speak here, ⁸⁸ but, as Me·
nochius and others write, from the action taken also we should be
perfectly clear on these points. Now, I have, I confess, considered
just what sort ol injustice of this character could exist here, but have
found none.

Furthermorc, the judge may pass over the other points which
are not involved 1n the action under consideration3 the prools may be 207
heard by the judge m camera3 thc judge may pass from the replies

f the defendant to his own interrogatione So Contardus explains
it. bb The whole subject matter ol the prools lies at the disposal
ol the judge. Thus there is no injustice which is evident, none which
is palpable, as they say. Then, too, in regard to the nullity which
they mention, I took under consideration ²⁰ what Baldus has in his
“ Replies,” namely, that if the libel involved also a question of own·
crship (as it does not in this case), and the judge (as he does here)
should confine his pronouncement to the question of possession, then
the decision would be null, because not in keeping with the writ nor
given on the points involved in the suit. And, baldus goes on to say,
it makes no difference if the judge reserves his decision on the question
ol ownership, because this reservation is a sort of precaution taken by
thfe judge and an embarrassing ol the suit So much lor the question
o nullity.

But, on the other hand, no matter how the action in the suit lor
ownership was taken, the judge should have pronounced on it also:
still, il by any chance he has not done so, his decision will not on
that account be void, no matter what Baldus may have said.
