The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. l. ' 5

liminium in time ol peace. Furthermore, in the time oi Quintius,
there had been little intercourse between the Greeks and the Romans,
and close relations between them began at that time, as Plutarch
writes. What il you were to say too that the Romans, oi whom we
were speaking, came to Greece, to their friends, through the avenues
of trade, and were sold by the Carthaginiensi ⁰One may maintain
that postliminium does not exist in this case, and that the buyer has
the right ol ownership; with good reason because, if another view
should be held, opportunity might be given the enemy of venting
his tage on the captiveswhom allies and common friends could not
buy, seeing that in their country the captives would regain their
liberty at once. Or opportunity might be taken to send these cap· 4
rives to barbarous peoples, who were more remote, and to other
more savage enemies, from whose land return would be extremely
difficolt. ¹’Felynus fitly remarks that “ this point applies more particu-
larly where captives taken by infidels are concerned, from the risk
that they fmay be led by violence or treachery to adopt the infidel's
mannero lile.”

Finally against Gama and against his uriheard ol distinction
one ought to observe that he even speaks against a judgment ren·
dered by a Collega [or bench of judges]; qand the decisions of
the Colleges are of more weight even than those oi a most distin·
guished jurist. rThis is the point which the Rota of Genoa makes
against the writer oi the decisions ol the Rota ol Avignon, that the
decision was that of the writer, not that ol the Rota. Others make
the same objection to a ruling of Afflictis, that he stands opposed
to the rest ol the College. Other writers make the same point in
other similar cases.

Now in continuing 1 would say ol Baldus and ol the other doctors
that he hesitates, and that all of them are talking ol a proscribed
person, that is ol a man regarded as an enemy because of an ollense
which he has committed. ¹Such a man is comparable to a fugitive.
But they are not talking oi an enemy who is waging war, as is the
case here. between him and the other there are very marked diher-
ences. tLikewise they apply this doctrine when an agreement has
been reached between allies, or when the treaty provides that the
territory of the allies shall be regarded as a unit, And Raldus
says that an alliance has no greater and no less scope than the agree·
ments themselves cover. I maintain too that one situation presente
itseli when we are dealing with punishment, which is ol course an
unpleasant thing, and which can be inflicted solely in the confines ol an

n ally attached to ourselves only; but, when, as in this case, the freeing
[oi people and property] is concerned, which is a beneficent act,
another situation comes up for discussion.
