The Pleas ol a Spanish Advocate, Bk. ll. 177

some supporting circumstance, '²⁸¹² lor instance, fraud and deception, is
combined with silence, it even the trial (we mean this trial now) is a
heated one too. In judicial proceedings the party who keeps silent
is always regarded as the consenting party, and this case expounders
ol the law everywhere accept, and this is what Menochius teaches.
⁰⁰⁰Thus others in the case ol an extension say, and even Vasquius
himself says, that it would be more commonly accepted and safer.
Now, it would not stand in the way of these arguments that
Menochius also teaches that they do not hold in the case of one who
is absent, nor even in the case oi one who is present, if he is ignorant
of what is going on—these two points I hear whispered about by
our adversaries—⁹⁹⁹ for we have shown that they all knew, and we tto
have said that some ol them were present, and it is undoubtedly true.
Besides this doctrine of Menochius seems to hold tor matters out·
side the court, since nothing is said of presence in l. saepe,² and
Ruinus, cited by Menochius, is talking of extrajudicial matters, and
il this were not so then there would be no special provision in the
case of judicial matters. Finally in our case we ought to remember
that the mere inconvenience of the owners is not at issue, when the
defense of their property is undertaken, and in the case ol the navi·
gator the dictum of Menochius would not hold, for what has been

handed over to the navigator under the mandate belongs in this case
altogether tothe absent owners. lndeed, several other replies can
be made to the same effect.
