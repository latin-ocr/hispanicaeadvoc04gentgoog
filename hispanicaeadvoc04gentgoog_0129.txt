The Pleas of a Spanish A dvocate, Bk. I. 103

are aware that words are to be understood according to the usage ol
the place.

The third argument is harmless‚ ²because it would have to be
proved that each of the two foreign parties to the suit shared that
usage [sc. of having judges versed some in civil and some in com·
mon law] with each other and with Spain. That transactione or
judgments as between certain individuale do not prejudice other in·
dividuals is fairly shouted by the laws and sanctioned hythe dic·
tates of reason. Then‚ too, usage itsell is strictly limited in nature.
It does not extend to other persons, to other cases, etc. For il any·
thing is done, ⁸²it would not be done except so iar as it is done;
the usage would not be such, except so far as it is in use. Granted
that these pettifoggers of the common law have pushed their way

into marriage cases, into testamentary, ecclesiastical and maritime
cases, and into others of this sort, which still have always been held

to be the peculiar province of those versed in the civil law, but granted 101

that they have pushed their way in, simply because those cases had
to do with Englishmen‚ with English concerns, with transactione car·
ried on in England; on this account, pray‚ shall they rush in and
seize these cases involving foreigners? Even though this state of
affairs is in part to be explained by the daily increasing power of

those who study the common law, Μ’ still the old landmarks should
be preserved.
