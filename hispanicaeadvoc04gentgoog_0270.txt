requires writing, while the contracting parties say that there shall
be an instrument or writing, it would be the more correct and the
more commonly accepted opinion, that an agreement would not be
called an absolute contract, even in the purpose of the contracting
parties, unless a document should be drawn up, because it is taken
for granted that the parties conform their action to the provisions of
the common law or the statute. But if the contractis of the sort that
under the common law, or under municipal law, or in practice re·
quires a document only by way of proof, not by way of completion
and validity, a document is not required, if it has not been expressly
arranged between the contracting parties that the contract should
be set down in writing, because in this case itis taken for granted that

the parties concerned have made their action conform to the pro·

visions of the law. iSalycetus presents this point well, and so Deci·

selves more than the law would bind them. He cites kalso Faber,
who says that a contractis called incomplete, when the parties con·

cerned have expressly arranged, that they should not be bound until
the instrument has been finished and published, a situation which fre·
quently arises between cautious people who are afraid of being de-
ceived. ¹Aretinus holds the same opinion, along with the distinction
made above by Salycetus‚ which he calls entirely correct, and he adds
that he has seen it observed in practice. The same writer says that
a document covering the agreement would not be required for the
completion and perfectiori of a transaction, but only by way of proof,
unless the parties concerned have expressly arranged that the trans-
action would not be valid otherwise, without a document. mSee
Johannes Petrus de Ferrariis. ¹¹The same view Jacobus Butriga·
rius holds, when he says that we understand a contract to be made
in writing, if it has been arranged that the contract shall hold, only
in case a document is drawn up. This he says everybody maintains.
It is the same, according to other writers, if I sell a thing to you,
using this adversative clause, “But l wish a document to be drawn
up ”; but when I make a sale without condition, and when l call a
notary and tell him to draw up a document, then it is not a contract
in writing, but the writing is to serve as a proof. These remarks
Decianus takes from Butrigarius.

But, pray, see if Decianus is not following constantly a kind
of false reasoning, from a contract in writing to a completed con·
tract. Indeed, the objection does not hold that the arrangement may
not be called a contract in writing, because it would be enough to have
the arrangement postponed to the future, as Ι have before responded
in quoting from Decius. But Decianus continues with his authors,
and praises ⁰ Barbatia for saying that he has seen this difficult ques·
