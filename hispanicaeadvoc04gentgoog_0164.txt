CHAPTER ll
Os M oney Given to a Witness

All the 'doctors assert that the expenses of witnesses should
be paid. bTherefore there is no doubt that money for these expenses
may be promised to them. Indeed, cas Ancharanus says, it is not
the pay which is forbidden, “and therefore to have induced wit·
nesses to come and testify, by offering them money, would not be a

135 proof that periury had been solicited, because money may be given
to meet the cost of travel and to cover expenses. eln the matter
of expensus those which the witness may have incurred at home are
not deducted‚ as the more commonly accepted opinion runs. Money
may even be paid him to compensate him for the work which he has
lost, the work on which he supports himself and his family, as

· Felynus remarks in following an opinion expressly given by Baldus.
‘To F elynus l add Fulgosius, as well as Andreas Gaillius who, be·
sides other authorities, cites the Delphinal practice. He says too that '
this custom is very just and quite reasonable. Felynus too, in fol·
lowing Baldus, remarks that it is lawful even to give money to a
witness to compensate him for the losses which he has sullered, for
instance, if he has been robbed by highwaymen while coming to give
his testimony, and when money is given in this way the value of the
evidence is not weakened.

Now, it is of no moment ‘that Francus and Gaillius whom I
have mentioned seem to write in opposition to this doctrine that
no regard should be paid to the time or the emoluments which a
witness may lose because of his absence, since a witness should not
look for gain in giving testimony, but should support the truth witll·
out recompense. Francus writes that a mistake is often made in
this matter because witnesses allow not only their expenses to be
refunded but their losses also to be made good, or they ask to have
it done. He remarks that this is contrary to the explicit dictum of
Baldus, which should be borne in mind, and that it violates the pro·
hibition of the law which allows the payment of expenses only.

Consequently, he would not approve of the testimony of a man who,
outside of his expenses, receives anything in violation of the prohibi·
tion of the law. These points are of no weight, l say, hsince
Baldus in the passage cited by Francus and Gaillius says: “The ex-

penses, but not the losses, of witnesses ought to be defrayed.”
