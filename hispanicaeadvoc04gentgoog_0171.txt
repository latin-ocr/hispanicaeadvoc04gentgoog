The Pleas of a Spanisls Advocate, Bk. ll. 145

on the strength oi the fleeting word ol his disclosure. Resides, a
witness may have iorgotten what he has said.

ΙΙΙ mention Baldus‚ too, who is more explicit. He writes that
evidence which a party has been allowed by a notary to see does not
lose its force. Consequently, much less would it lose its force owing
to disclosures by a witness. ⁰1 am surprised that Decianus, in the
case of evidence which has been read, says that much ol its credibility ¹
is lost. He makes the statement, but offers no proof of it. pThat
the notary would be punished, as well as the witness, is quite true,
as Decianus and others. remark. But that is another question.
‘¹The notary who discloses the testimony of witnesses before it has
been made public is held for betrayal of trust; thus, one was con·
victed at Padua on my advice and the advice of other doctors,
says Jacobus de Belviso. He makes the same remark in the case
of an advocate or an agent who discloses documenta and other secret
matters; in the case of a judge who discloses his verdict before an·
nouncrng it.

'The testimony of witnesses is not invalidated, even if the parties
have been present at the examination, although (and this too is an·
other matter) the parties in this case would not be able to introduce
new witnesses concerning the same points, or concerning directly 142
opposite points, because they bave learned the testimony.

Itis one question whether the word prodiderunt in the aforemen-
tioned law indicates a disclosure, as Cervottus and several others have
claimed3 and another, whether the credibility of the witnesses
who make a disclosure is lessened, as no writers except Fulgosius
and Albericus assert. The law mentioned above talks of punishing
such witnesses, not of invalidating their evidence. Also, it is one
question which arises in the case of witnesses revealing what they
have said, and another question in the case of those who state in ad·
vance what they are going to say. The latter is the question before
us, and in it we have no one arguing on the other side, so far as Ι
know, while we bave with us all those writers who on the former ques-
tion hold that a disclosure does not prejudice evidence which has
been given.

We have not only the clear statements of Hartmannus and
Salycetus, 'but also of Panormitanus and Felynus, who write clearly
that the evidence of a person is not invalidated if he has stated in
advance in the presence oi a party concerned what he was to say in
the trial. lndeed they maintain that it is a precaution to have him
brought in to make a statement io advance, so that he may not have
ground for changing his testimony. tThis would be the noteworthy l
philosophical argument ol Bartolus, uand with reference to this
philosophical argument, we would observe here that, although it
