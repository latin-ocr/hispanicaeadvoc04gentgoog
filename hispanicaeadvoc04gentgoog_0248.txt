222 Alberico Gentili

in the future. But here Ι stop, either because Ι think 1 have given

sufficient proof that the wares should now be offered for sale-
the question put in your first chapter-or because 1 think that with
you 1 have transgressed tbe limits of modesty in that 1 wish to argue
on theology with you, a learned theologian. Pardon a body not
now in good health and a mind perhaps embarrassed in this matter
and fattering itself. Do you decide. F arewelll Love me in return.

So much for yesterday; just these points this morning. The
danger in delay is of the slightest. If the other side should want
a new valuation made, it will gain its request easily through the law,
and bring longer delays upon us and stir up fresh troubles. If it
should desire that we appoint new bondsmen to guarantee the return
of the price, and that the goods be not retailed before they are
appointed, it will necessarily be heard.

My Lord‚ thus Ι might point out considerations to prove the
utility of a sale today. But it would be useless to add proofs for this
matter already proved more than enough, especially for a wise man,
such as you are, for whom, according to the proverb, a word is
enough. Ι shall add, however, that generalization of Aristotle:
As a general rule, the opposite of what our enemies want is clearly
the more advantageous. But our enemies do not want the goods to
be sold. Therefore it is more advantageous that the goods be sold.
This is my opinion: these are my lines of reasoning which are to
make you also of my opinion, even though they seem baldly put.
And yet if that well-known line of action followedby Duke Albanus
against the Lusitanians should not prevail single-handed against all
these which Ι have mentioned, yet remember that our adversaries are
not so formidable as to know how to make use of the opportunities

221 mentioned above. “But yet it is not a mark of one's wisdom to trust
always in the unwisdom of his adversaries, just because Albanus once
trusted with good results in that of the Lusitaniam.
