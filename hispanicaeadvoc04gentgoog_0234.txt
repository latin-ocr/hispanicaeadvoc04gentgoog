ambassador more powerful here where the ambassador of the fed·
erated provinces of Belgium stands on the other side?

And then does not even Contardus himself give the opinion that
this exception is void if a satisfactory bond is given, as must now be
done. ⁰The same reply was given by the Council of the Emperor,
and also by the Council of Ticinum, of Padua, and of bologna,as
may be seen in Menochius on the Finariensian case.

rFurther, Menochius himself does not object strongly where
the security is sufficient, and surely he will not single-handed have
much weight against so many learned authorities and colleges.
“ He is defending all by himself a strange proposition that is far
removed from the view of others.¹’ In that case Menochius is
speaking of himself, and in the prefate to those ‘⁴ Replies.'’ If the
Spanish ambassador loses his case afterwards in another court, there
is nothing to prevent bis being forced to bow to the decision3 at
least they who are given as bondsmen must accept it. There is no
question here of the possession of a strongly fortihed citadel such as
there is in the case of Contardus and others, and the giving of sc·
curity always removes that exception.

They bring forward another objection, namely, thatin this case
the question of ownership is involved and connected with the issue.
But how is the question involved here? qThey equivocate in alleging
that it is involved, not understanding the words of learned authorities
on the question. We have no confusion of issues‚ even though the
question of possession and the question of ownership are before the
one and same court at the same time. Things are said to be in·
separably related only when the principle applying to the one cannot

206 be divorced from that applying to the other. Such are the examples
noted in this connection, and such is the treatment of real equivoca-
tion by my learned friend, Eugenius, but there is no parallel in this
case.

Then with reference to the equivocal assertion that there is a
confusion of issues ‘here, the conclusion of the libel should be ex-
amined that it may appear whether a suit for possession alone is held
in viewc but neither in the conclusion nor in any other part of the
document is anything mentioned which necessarily brings in a suit for
ownership. 'Neither the word ‘⁴ property '³ nor the word “ con·
sider ‘’ which we employed [carries any such implication]. We sought
to have possession made free for us, we did not use the expression
-which is believed to form the conclusion in an application for

² ownership-“that it be freely released.'’ We sought to have the
possession freed, that is, merely released, made free from the seizurc
under which it now lies. tThen, too (even though the suits for pos·
session and for ownership had been before the court at the same
