The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. ll. 2 57

his great-grandfather was made a citizen, must be admitted as though

descended from a native-born grandfather. So Menochius replied.
Then, too, another statute had made provision that one should not
be elected to the college by cobptation unless he were born in wed-
lock ¹²¹¹¹¹ But one made a legitimate child by a subsequens marriage
is to be chosen, replied the same doctor.

Then there are statutes which forbid those joining a college,
whose parents have plied a low calling, whether mechanical or man·
ual; ffi and yet the son of a surgeon-this calling is not sordid in this
connection, though sordid elsewhere-may join a college, Cephalus
replied, even though that surgeon practiced blood-letting, a subsidiary 259
part of surgery‚ a lowly calling and one which comes within the pur·
view of the statute. ld‘¹‘Then, too, the man should bc elected by
cooptation, whose father was a drygoods merchant-this trade is not·
lowly in this connection-and at the same time did other lowly work ·
in addition, to supplement his trading, Menochius replied. ¹¹¹ And the
same is true of the man whose father was a clerk. mmmNow, the
office of a clerk is an humble one according to common law. ‘¹¹¹¹' The
same thing is true of another whose father was a treasurer for
strangers, and at a fixed salary. Those cases always have the prin·
ciple applied that statutes are to be taken in a liberal sense. In
another statute mention was made ol not receiving into the college of
Doctus-Advocates a man who cannot be an advocate. 000Α clergy·
man who cannot plead must certainly be received as a doctor and also
asan advocate, replied Alciatus, because the clergyman could plead in
writing‚ and in person too in many cases, and this statute should re·

ceive a liberal interpretation.
There was another statute providing for the admission of the

man who had a majority voting for him. 1>¹³¹’He too should be ad·
’ mitted, replied the same man, who has secured half the votes. ‘m Of
course, in case of doubt the decision should be given for admission,
because it would be the more benelicent, as the same authority
asserts.

“¹ In the case of the two statutes, the first of which provides for
the acceptance of a majority vote, and the other instructs us to fol·
low the decision of a two-thirds vote, the former should be followed
and should be preferred to the latter for the reason especially that it
would bc more beneficial, as Cephalus replies, ⁸⁵⁵ in spite of the fact
“ that the later arrangements are more binding than those which pre·
cede them.” ‘¹² Furthermore, as to the number of votes, Ι observe
that, although it was stipulated by another statute that the man should
be considered elected who had been elected by two-thirds of the votes,
and although a certain person had received twenty-seven out of forty-
two votes, Menochius replies that he is considered elected, and De· 260
