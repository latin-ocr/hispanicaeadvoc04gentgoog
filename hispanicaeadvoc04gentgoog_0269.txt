otherwise if they enter into a contract at the outset and intend to have
a document drawn up afterward by way of proof. Thus he explains
the gloss there and elsewhere, and this gloss other writers seem
to follow, and ²Odofredus and Albericus, who write concerning the
opinion of Speculator, pertinently remark in that connection that
the form of procedure of the law mentioned is not observed in
practice today. Decianus says too that Angelus clearly holds on the
same passage that a definite arrangement between the parties to that
effect is required, if the contract is to be binding only in case a docu-
ment be drawn up. Still to others he would seem to hold the opposite
opinion in that connection; the same is true of Castrensis elsewhere.
Fulgosius, Jason, Socinus, Afflictis, Decius seem to follow him.
Decianus cites the eleventh opinion of Decius. ln this opinion
Decius writes that a contract would not be considered complete be·
fore the instrument was made, if it was stated that an instrument
should be made to cover the transaction. This practice was followed
at Florence. He says that it is not really an objection that it may not
be called a contract in writing, because the fact that the arrange·
ment is postponed to a future tirne, and that there is, therefore, an
opportunity for a change of heart, would be enough. Indeed, De·
cius really holds this view, he does not merely seem to hold it, and
Decianus does not act honorably in concealing these authorities in
this way. ‘Why did he not even cite Decius, where Decius defends
the position quite fully, and why does he not even cite in support
of this side Castrensis in the opinions, of which Decianus says noth·
ing? A contract or a will is not called complete unless the instru· 243
ment is drawn up which the parties or the testator have wished to
have made; itis not, even though it may have been made lor reli·
gious purposes, according to Oldradus, and in his writings the res
iudicatae are quoted. Johannes Andreae and Johannes de Anania
approve the same doctrine, and yet Decianus does not even mention
thenr. There may be also other res iudicatae to the same ellect;
Cephalus also takes this view, and he cites Azo and ‘Placentinus
Furthermore, ¹¹ Decius also says, concerning a transaction entered into
by the Pontill, that because the Pontill wished a contract to be made by
the Camera, this fact would show that there was no effective arrange·
ment with him to make this a similar case of contracting parties who
wish a contract to be reduced to writing, This is what Decius holds.
But Decianus says that the view of Castrensis is not true and
should not be followed, and that the more commonly accepted view
is against him. In a contract, which, in accordance with the form re·
quired hythe common law, like an emphyteutic contract, or in accord·
ance with the form requiredby a statute, or from the force of custom,
