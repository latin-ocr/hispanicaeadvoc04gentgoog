The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. ll. 155

are taken lor granted in the case ol those acts which it is not probable
that anyone would undertake to perform without instructions. There
is no doubt in the case where the master both knows and can prevent
the action. Therelore, it is taken lor granted that these acts ol the
navigator are the acts ol the owners, since they could have been ol
advantage to the owners. Therelore, also, it is taken lor granted
that they knew ol these matters.

Or perchance could they not have been inlormed ol what was
going on here? In so many wecks, months even, has no letter
gone from here to Holland? Has no letter come back to this 151
country from Holland? Yet regular public letter carriers have sev·
eral times gone back and lorth in this whole period. ¹There are
“ sufficient ” grounds to inler knowledge lrom the lact that the places
are near each other. Holland, where these owners are said to have
been, is distant by an easy voyage ol one or two days, ’il we
believe, as the law holds, that on a voyage fifty miles is the usual
distance lor a single day. 'Places are near at hand which are not
lar away. ⁸⁸ What is not distant more than two days by sea is called
nearby. So the judge would say at any rate, bb to whose decision
the question ol settling the matter ol proximity would be assigned,
c‘'il the decision is to be given in accordance with the rules ol
common law, and to bc in harmony with approved principles. Here
notice in addition the long period ol time, as l have said.

‘'dBcsides we assume that those who have known a part have
known the rest also, as others, including Menochius in his responses,
remark. They have heard nothing about the suitl “ Let the Jew ,
Apella believe it.‘’² But if some have known, we assume that the rest
know too, eesince the argument is valid in passing from things to
persons. ¹¹ Cravctta, in talking ol the knowledge of a third person
who wishes to delay the execution ol a sentence brought likewise
against a second party, shows that a partner is presumcd to know
the acts of a partner, and undoubtedly subsequent results, and lawsuits
particularly. He shows too that, even il there is no partnership, it is
taken lor granted that the third party knows ol the trial ol a note·
worthy matter in controversy. He shows that even a long lapse
ol time would not lead to ignorante ol a thing ol this sort. There·
fore, I would say also that it is taken lor granted that a partner in
the merchandise in a given vesscl would know acts like these on the
part ol a partner. There is partnership in this case-this is evident
from the treatment ol jettison, as well as from the proverb, “to be
carried in the same ship,‘’ and from similar reasoning, and from
other arguments.
