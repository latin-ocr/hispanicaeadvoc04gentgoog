The Pleas of a Spanish Advocato, Bk. I. 75

which is the first case. But if the third case is not the same as the
second mentioned-and it is not, unless it is superfluous—it would
undoubtedly deal with the uncertain, as 1 said, and as the words 71
themselves, I maintained, indicate.

But now, if this case falls within the sphere of the uncertain,
then it will be the judge's duty to decide what regulation should be
adopted regarding restitution. ⁰For even though the sovereign
should order that anything attacked alter a lixed time should be left
unchanged, yet this is understood of unjust attack merely, and there·
fore il the judge shall here consider the justice of the deed, the action
will not be canceled at once. The judge will take into consideration
the lact that, though these acts were done in the name of the state,
yet the expense was private and the advantage private; and also that
further expense hasbeen incurred to secure pardon for waging this
sort of warfare‚ so that this case is not on a par with that one con·
cerning which Ι have spoken elsewhere, as Ι said in the beginning.
And undoubtedly the King will desire to interiere less with these
private individuals than with his public servants in general.

He will perhaps be unwilling to take the fruit ol their toil and
expense from men who had not heard of the edict, since he did not
make the law binding on them until alter the day when peace was
definitely established. Let the man who maintains that the law is
binding on those ignorant of it prove this from the words that
account must be rendered of acts committed after that twenty-fourth
day. This day concerns thern, I admit, and likewise an obligation is
imposed‚ but what is this obligation? Here we have a capture. The
law says there is an obligation to give an account, it does not say
to give back the property. No obligation beyond the one already
fixed should be imposed upon those who had not heard of the edict.
Of course, their ignorance should be examined to see whether itis
only pretended, whether it is blameworthy, etc.; ¹'for although a law
is not as a rule binding on those who do not know of it, still there are
numerous cases where it does bind thern, ‘¹ just as on the contrary
the provisions ol a statute are not binding on those who with reason
are believed not to have known of them. Now, these are the con·
siderations which make me hesitate on that question about the word·
ing of the peace articles.
