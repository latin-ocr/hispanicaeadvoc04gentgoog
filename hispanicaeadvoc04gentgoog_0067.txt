The Pleas of a Spanislr Advocate, Bk. I. 41

grain out of a country shall be punished, since it is certain that, after
he has gone out of the country, the officials cannot pursue him.
Therefore, the principle may be observed that, when appre-
hended on the road, he may be punished, just as if he had carried the
grain out. ”And on this point Baldus subtly remarks that the offense
hasbeen consummated, because it was through no fault of the actor
‚that it was not, as well as because the loading of the merchan-
dise, not the mere transportation of it, is punished, if itis clear that
the man has taken this step with the intention of going to places
where he is forbidden to go. Consequently, the oliense has already
taken its shape, as every offense must before it is punishable, and
therefore is consummated, etc.

But, without being hindered by these and other similar considera·
tions which do not really stand in our way, 1 think that the contrary
view is the more correct one, namely, that the Dutch may not put to
death the Britons who are setting out to serve under the Spaniard. 1 39
am influenced by the very cogent argument that these Britons arc not
enemies unless they are soldiers of the enemy, and they are not soldiers
of the enemy, so long as they are not enrolled in the lists. ¹Notice
the law: “ Those whose names are not yet in the lists, even if they
have been picked out and are traveling at public expense, are not yet
soldiers.” *A man has not yet been selected as a soldier who has not
satisfied the three conditions of being put down in the lists, equipped,
and stigmatized, asin any clection three processes are regularly called
lor: choice, confirmation, entrance into office3 and before the en·
trance into office occurs this law is not satisfied. The constitution of a
person in the physical sense results only from the three processes:
procreation, development, birth. Consequently, the constitution of a
person in the civil sense results only from the three processes which
have been mentioned, for civil processcs are parallel to those of

nature. When a manis set down as an heir, you have procreation;
when the testator dies, development; when one enters into an in·
ὴεῑὶιξαῃςε, birth. Thus, before the property is made over, there is
no err.

Like this are the other cases which Jacobus de Arena discusses
in Cynus in that question of former days, whether the emperor has
all his power before his coronation. Now, although in the case of
the emperor, they reach the opposite conclusion, they do so for other
reasons, and they leave these arguments of ours unweakened. In
beneficent matters, they say, actions begun are regarded as completed.
This case of the exercise of imperial power is beneficent. Therefore,
say l, in prejudicial matters an action begun will not be regarded as
completed, and this right to exercise the power of an enemy takes the
form of a prejudicial act. Now, these arguments are not weakened
