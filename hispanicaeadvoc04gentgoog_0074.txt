took place whenever a few Dutch were added to the crew as a blind,
while the English remained in reality the leaders of the expedition;
but here the Dutch ship herself would be in control. They will add,
further, that the scope of the edict should not be extended to include
this case, which lies without its letter and intent. These are the

46 difficulties which 1 raised in my own mind, on taking the defense of
the Spaniards.

It is my invariable custom to ponder carefully what can be
urged against the side which 1 have to defend. Now, the difficulties
I have just raised did not trouble me at all, and 1 contended that·
the British ship was piratical‚ that the Dutch ship should receive no

’ part of the booty, but that rather everything should be restored to
the Spaniards. ‘Then, too, 1 made use of that principle, elsewhere
lirmly established, that the Dutch had not acquired a legal title to
the property, because it had not been brought within their own forti·
fied lines, and because the property in question, on being brought
through the territory of our King, reverted at once to its former
owners. But likewise, the wording of the edict, as 1 asserted, applied
to the present case, because it makes a ship piratical if the majority
of the crew are British, and on board this ship all are British.

Then, further, the intent of the edict, which is to prevent eva·
sions of the law, would cover this cases and here we should have a
most flagrant evasion, where the very thing forbidden is done in
some unforeseen way. ‘Evasion lies in the method‚ and there are
many methods, ‘against all of which provision must be made; such
is the demand at once of both private and public interest. *Precau
tion must always be taken against everything elusory, that is, every
indirect nullification of the law, and against everything illusory,
that is, every specious deception. ¹And lest any of these [forms
of evasion] occur, we have, too, an extension of the law, where
criminals are concerned, through the principle of the “faulty’'
etc.; so little is it our duty to summon fictions to the aid of those
subterfuges, just as we have an evident fiction there, where two
vessels are regarded as one. The intent of the edict, the purpose of
the King was to hinder the Britons in the practice of piracy. Con·
sequently, that intent, that most laudable purpose should receive
assistance by every interpretation.

And so, if the piratica} ship which secured the booty is British,
what right, pray, will the Dutch convoy have to that booty? To the
British ship comes none of the booty secured. The Dutch vessel's
share comes from what the British ship has. Therefore, to the

47 Dutch ship comes nothing, since its share is but a part of the whole
quantity gained by the British, which amounts in all to absolutely
nothing. The Britons cannot give others what they do not have;
