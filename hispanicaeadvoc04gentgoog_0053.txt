The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. l. 27

takes Imola in this general sense, for on his authority he writes that
the territory of a third party ought to be safe even for one merely
passing through it. They who have conducted captives through
another's territory commit an offense, andare therefore required

to give them up or to give satisfaction otherwise, says lmola. And
therefore in the case now before us, when the property and the men
are here, they should be preserved in their liberty, say l, for, if men
transported by this routewere to be demanded rightfully, it will be
m'uch more equitable to keep them back. And this dictum of lmola
and Bellus found in the very terms covering the question should be
needed, not that given explicitly by Caepolla, concerning the criminal,
who will be led off with greater ease and iustice.

Further, the reason why Caepolla makes that statement is that
he thinks the status of a church and of a territory are the same-a 25
thing which is false, as I bave shown tn the preceding chapter. F alse
too is the claim of Decianus that the Church has no rights here, as 1
shall make clear in the following chapter.

The only thing true is that which we noted in the matter of
grain. But that question is not like the one now before us, since
it does not concern a city, if grain, which has not been grown in its
territory or has not otherwise become the property of the city, be -
carried through it. 'And this reason is offered by Jason and by
another writer to show why it is lawful to take it through a city.
He who passes through a city cannot be said to take from the city-
a thing which the statute forbids. ‘To pass through is to enter and
to go out. ’

Yet it does concern a territory that there be no one but the
ruler of the territory to inspire fear in it. It is of importance to
this ruler not to see another inspiring fear in anyone in his territory.
Itis of importance that no captives whatever be taken, held, or
dragged off except by order of the ruler of the territory, for these
acts derive from jurisdiction, and jurisdiction in the territory of our
king does not belong to any foreigner, ⁸⁸ so that the crime of keep·
ing a private prison or lese-majeste' is committed when another holds
captives in territory nothis own. This is the claim in the case before
us, in which sovereignty and jurisdiction are being asserted.

Besides, profit is not being taken from the Dutch, nor favor
shown the Spaniards. What I have said of the transportation of a
dead body involves a dillerent principle. In that instance no wrong
is done to the territories concerned; no force is applied to anyone,
and the cause of religion is most beneficent. Whatl I pray, shall
this deed of the Dutch escape punishment because that involved in
the transport of a dead body is not punished? Shall this use of force
by the Dutch fail of cbeck, l pray you, because that act which I men·
