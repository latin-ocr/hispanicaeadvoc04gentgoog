The Pleas ol a Spanish Advocate, Bk. ΙΙ. 159

people have no chance now except by fighting in their own names,
desperate as their course is, at least to delay the execution of the
sentence pronouneed in favor of the Spanish Ambassador. What
further may they hope for, since they have been defeated in that case
where they had especially put their hope? sssesides, Cravetta also
says that fraud is inferred from an unusual procedure, and I say that
it is an unusual, an unheard of thing that a navigator should be a
party to an action covering merchandise of such value, when the
owners are near at hand, present, acquainted with the facts, but saying
nothing, and lying in concealment. The same doctor mentions
more points, too, of this sort, by which he lays bare the bad faith
ol the third party against whom he is arguing. By these same points
we lay bare the bad faith of our adversaries. He adds too that a
single inference, “a single suspicion suffices to lay bare bad faith,‘' and
therefore it would not be difficult to decide what one should say in ·
the case of many and more serious suspicions.

All of these points, indited as it were against these opponente
of ours, we also urge. ‘Intent to deceive cannot be readily deter-
mined, except from inferences, etc. ⁸Cravetta says that collusion of
the third party in such a case with the litigant has been “very clearly ’²
revealed. But there is no reason why we should not say the same
thing of the collusion between our third parties and the navigator.
1Ἰ add that less serious suspicions ought to count here in establish-
ing bad faith, since the case is summary, involves an execution, allows 155
the introduction of a simpler counter argument, and concerns posses·
sion, as Contardus says, who also therefore adds that it may properly ¹
be inferred that a slighter presumption of bad faith would suffice. ἰΙ
also say that instances of bad faith most readily arise and are fre·
quent in these cases of opposition, and they often originate in evil
intent, deceit, malice, wrongdoing,—more frequently than in justice, to
quote the words of Covarruvias.

¹‘From this fact the conclusion also which is very frequently
taught is very properly drawn, that a third party taking an appeal
ought in his appeal to set forth an express reason, even if otherwise
a reason would not have to be given in an appeal from a definitive
verdict, for when an appeal is taken contrary to the rule of the law,
“on account of the presumption of evil intent ’‘ it should not be
admitted unless it be justified by an express reason. ¹That which is
“ easily ‘⁹ dissociated from a thing, says Baldus, does not prove the
existence of that thing. Therefore‚ say I, that which “ most easily,‘'
“ frequently,” “ nay generally ” is associated with a thing would prove
the existence of that thing, ¹¹¹since the argument from that which
frequently happens is strongest in the case of presumption and proofs‚
being especially powerful, valid‚ and efficacious there, etc. nBut where
