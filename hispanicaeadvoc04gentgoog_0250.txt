CHAPTER XXIV

Of a Decree of the Judye in a Care ol Possession
A LETTER ’ῘῸ THE massanos

The judge ordered that everytbing be sold at retail and the price
divided between the two parties to be held until a more complete
decision should be given. And apparently he has not dealt un·
lavorably with us in respect to this case ol possession, lor our clients,
being torcibly detained, can themselves scarcely be regarded as in pos·
session. 'He too seems dispossessed who is in restraint, as our men
were3 but yet I do not say that our clients ceased to possess in the
civil sense, inasmuch as they might have had the mind and natural
hope ol recovering, and this has been touched on in our reply. But
in this action to secure possession, civil possession is not certainly
taken into account; since, indeed, as soon as his worship, the judge,
has ascertained the facts in regard to the ownership, he can be
forced, apart from any other consideration, to make a pronouncement
on the question of ownership. ¹’“ Il the judge has ascertained the
laets regarding any matter, he will be forced to make his pronounce-
ment,'’ says the law. eAnd the commentators say that when he has
ascertained the laets regarding the possession, at the same time as
those regarding the ownership, he will even be forced by the former
to make pronouncement regarding the latter also.

Now, my reply dealt with the question of ownership and re·
garding it Ι have good hope, although 1 see something even yet
about which the judge may have his doubts. Why, pray, he will
exclaim, should these goods be released, even though they cannot be
held in restraint in the territory ol the King? How does that fol·
low? How does that follow for the prisoners themselves? Surely
they cannot under the King's law accuse the captor, the assailant;
dfor they, being enemies, may be slain with perfect right anywhere,
not merely captured, if the sovereign of the territory should not for-
bid it. Even now let these assailants be expelled under a penalty,
as Clarus¹ expresses his view with regard to thieves withdrawing

from alien territory to that oi Milan.
The judge will bring forward as another objection the long

interval of two months, during which the freebooters held their booty
