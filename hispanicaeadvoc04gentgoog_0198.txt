of many things and the incorrectness of many others. It has to a
great extent overthrown the teachings of Bartolus and similar inter·
preters.'' The point is made with equal propriety that ¹’very many
errors made by the doctors have passed over into the Decreta.
qIndeed, as the same doctor and others teach, Decretales have been
made out of many glosses of the civil law. This point would count
there too if perchance the above-mentioned ch. pen.¹ shall be urged
against this party, although “the next in order '’ (sequens) in that case
would be no other than he is in l. saepe,² as also the words show
which are subjoined to it in that passage and which are to be con·
nected with the same case, as Covarruvias explains. The discussion
of this point is difficolt, yet in it 1 support the opposite side to that
defended above.

Now, 1 acknowledge the rule that a res iudicata between certain
persons should not injure others, 'butl also say that there are more
than thirty limitations to this rule. I assert that even accepting
Dynus's interpretation of the words “next in order ‘’ (sequenti), i. e.,
that he is the prior owner and therefore the person who precedes,
not the one who follows—I assert that it does not, however, follow
that the law would say that damage is done to others only when the
sequens [i.e., owner] brings the action. The reasoning of the law
teaches a different principle, that the knowledge of a third party who
can forbid an action and his tolerance of the action are taken in the

169 light of consent and of instructions in judicial matters. ·This reason-
ing hasbeen commonly accepted in this case by all civilists and l
canonists,¹ and this reasoning furnishes us with an argument against
the Dutch who have suffered the navigator to go to law about the
ship's merchandise which they say is' theirs. He who can prevent
another from acting, and yet does not do so, clearly prejudices his
case. Now, these lhrtchmen could have stopped the navigator.
Covarruvias, who does not support the general line of reasoning,
regularly held and mentioned above, ought not to influente us.
Against the common reasoning he turns also ch. pen, De sent. et re
judicata.² ’Νοῦς it satisfias the law, if the man who allows action
has his case from him who goes to law, or if he who goes to law has
his case from him who allows action, if either of them has a case from
the other. For the decretal mere knowledge of the legal action and
tolerance of it is enough. ¹¹ So Ancharanus says that it is the “ com·
mon rule ” that the third party who knows that another is taking
legal action concerning a matter which pertains to him, and permits
it, if he does not make opposition, and make opposition in fact by
appealing against the verdict‚ “cannot hinder the execution of the
verdict.” Likewise Innocent “in all his dicta holds ’³ to this point,
