The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. II. 191

half of the Dutch against the Spanish a certain decree of his predeces-
sor, a very well-balanced man, and the new judge had, fsharne to say,
been advocate in that case against the Spaniards, and this decree his
predecessor, who had made it, for very just reasons brought forward
by us, had never been willing to hand over for execution. Here in
another case he gave the privileges of a fiscus to the fiscus of Barbary,
to our detriment; in this case he ridiculed in various ways the rights
of the Spanish fiscus to our disadvantage. In this case involving Bar-
bary did he read “the response of Ruinus which Ι cited? Did he
weigh our oral and written argument against that fiscus of Barbary?
At eight o’clock in the evening he was asked by me to examine all the
points-at sunrise the next morning he gave a judgment against us.
After hearing the representatione of six advocates on the other side
up to the bour for dinner, right after dinner he gave an interlocutory
detrec, without examining other statements (I believe this, at any
rate), even those of a large number of pleaders, or hthe opinion of
Cravetta (this I know for sure) on which our strongest argument 137
was based. He even did this, although the question involved in this
interlocutory decree was so long and intricate—namely‚ whether a
third party may be admitted to delay the execution of a judgment
against another-that the resolution of it would not be very easy. He
ought to have read other writers: he ought to have read Alexander,
who has written a volume on l. saepe²3 ithis [paragraph in the
Diqest] lacks in system, as even Zasius observes, ¹‘and the Presi-
dent of the Neapolitan council says that the article is handed down
in a confused way by the doctors. Still why do we gather other π
points? Is there anybody who has heard him or seen him pleading
against us, and not felt that he was hostile tous, since that interlocu-
tory decree was handed down? ιΑ judge may keep his opinion
and intervene in its support, mand still he who has been a judge
should guard his reputation by not becoming an advocate. What of
a man who is even yet a judge? Whether he has acted as a judge
should act, do you, distinguished men, consider, before whom he has
argued. ”A judge’s attitude is very clearly revealed from his dis·
cussion with a party concerned. 1 say no more of one who is very
friendly to me, and a very learned man. These remarks I wish to
make, with the kind permission of the judge himself, for the justice
of the cause which I defend.

⁰But if on the score of a single appeal pending in another case,
it is not lawful to reject a judge, as the common opinion runs, then
where there is more than one appeal, it will be lawful to reject a
judge. pThe matter of rejecting a judge is beneficial, as the Rota
has decided. ‘¹Indeed, divine reason and the reason of nature pre-
