definitive verdict. -f An interlocutory decree has the force of a defini·
tive verdict, if it determines even indirectly an article looking to a
definitive verdict3 ii the function of the judge comes to an end; it
another verdict is not hoped ior; it the interlocutory decree contains
something to be given or to be done. ‘But when a verdict is null
and void, it will not even be called a verdict. Therefore, the execu-
tion oi it ought not to be ordered; when ordered, it ought to be can-
celed; when carried out, it ought to be reconsidered. In our case
233 nullity will the more check an execution, since the execution even of a
valid verdict would be checked in this case, ior I have said that these
eight chests are at present retained to cover the expenses of the suit,
to help meet losses. ²¹“ So benelicent is the right of retention that
it prevails even against the execution of a verdict, and retention is
especially privileged.” Again, I beg his illustrious Lordship, the
judge, to consider what I have said conceming the Dutch enemy,
for these eight chests ought in no wise to be handed over to him.
Why, if the Spaniard wishes to commit an oliense against the laws of
his King, and the ambassador asks the judge not to allow the subject
to commit such an ollense, will the judge not think this request oi the
ambassador just? Not only the law of the King forbids all trading
with the enemy, ibut all laws forbid it. We shall say that the Span-
iard did not know that this man whom he made his agent was a Dutch·
man, to avoid concluding that he committed an oliense, ksince igno·
rance is taken for granted, at least ior the purpose of excluding the
hypothesis of an oliense. Consequently, we shall conclude that we
are not to understand that a mandate was really given because oi
this error in the character of the person ol the agent, and that to this
eliect the Spaniard will doubtless reply, if he is questioned, and,
therefore, that he has replied and now replies in this way, ¹hecause
it is a well-known and well-established rule ior all arrangements that
that which one would probably have said and done, if he had been
questioned, is regarded as said and done. Let an opportunity be
given us to ask questions. We will show clearly the Spaniard's wish.
We will show that it was nothis purpose to go to law with the am-
bassador, and yet why do 1 drag in the ambassador here, against
whom 1 lind no decree handed down? Agaiust whom will the execu-
tion oi the decree be made? mThe execution oi a judgment is not
directed against a man against whom the judgment has not been given.
234 But if his Lordsbip, the judge, thinks that he can correct that error
which is noted in the lirst and second chapters dealing with nullity,
¹'which would be, as it were, an error in nomenclatore, since those
eight chests are indicated in the decree by other brands than those
which they are said in the petition to beqr, ⁰ l will reply that a verdict
which is null and void cannot be corrected or emended, even at once.
