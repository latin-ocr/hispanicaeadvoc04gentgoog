CHAPTER III

On the Judqment Passed by Soldiers and on the V aryinq Practice in
the M atter of Thinqs captured by the Enemy

‘Ripa does not accept the decision made by soldiers concerning
things captured from the enemy, although he gives it at the end of his
discussion to the following effect: “ Still our soldiers say that cap·
tured property is theirs‚ if they have kept it with thern for a night.''
He supports a different opinion held by Angelus, offering a better
legal principle to establish it. bNeither is the opinion of the doctor
given, although at the end he makes the statement: “Some

12 others hold,” or “according to some writers,’' nor is it probable
that Ripa thought the decision of the soldiers a just one even in
their own case. Even in the decision of the soldiers, pray what does
“with them’' (apud se) mean? Perhaps it means the same as
within their fortified lines, cas the expression runs, “a son brought
up with the enemy,’' “to die with the enemy,'’ “ to be with them.'’
And sothe ruling of the soldiers is in harmony with the law, but it
is at variance with those who would require a period of three
days, and with those who hold that he who had owned the captured
goods must have turned to other matters. This is the English law,

Ι and the law of Castile, which in like manner make acquisition depend
on retention in the territory of the enemy for a night, or on a delay
of twenty-four hours.

And it is natural for law to harmonize with law. Still
soldiers themselves do not think that goods have been acquired,
provided they have merely been brought within fortified lines, unless
they have also been kept for a night, and on this point they are at
variance with the law, which makes a thing the property of the
capturas s'oon as it has been brought within fortified lines. There-
fore the article recovered before nightfall is again acquired by him
who recovers it, as Bellus explains. Unless perchance in this case of
quick recovery you would indorse the view of the soldiers, dbecause
a thing which has been recovered at once we should not consider
captured. eAlciatus says that “a thing which has not yet been held
in the territory of the enemy for a night may be thought of as recov-
ered at once, and that the military prefects usually follow this prin-

o ciple.'' Now this was the doctrine of Salycetus, which Ι have reported

⁸ at thc end of the last chapter.
