acquired. This is not the case with the Turks now, as everybody
surely knows, (Μ although Straccha may not have considered this in
setting down the opposite view, but his conclusion is in the very terms
of the law.

l add the fact, too, that if any ol the articles which were being
carried for the use of the ship were leit over, the English could
lawlully sell them. “So, to speak of the things which can be pro·
vided merely for one’s own use, it has been held that they may be
sold, if there is no use for them afterward.

By a fourth considerationi am led to the same line of defense,
“that the mere carriage ol contraband is not such per se, but [it is
unlawful], because it would seem to assist in doing a wrong, that is,
in giving aid to the Turks. This assistance, since in this case it
would be many stages removed, would not imply irregularity, to say
nothing of any other criminal ollense. Thus, lor instance, the man
who furnishes a remote incentive to homicide would not be guilty of
an irregularity. This is literally the reply made by a man ol clear
judgment and of eminent erudition and uprightness. To the
same ellect Navarrus, who praises the man I have mentioned, lays
down the ruling that he who builds triremes lor the Turks gives them
a very remote incentive to light the Christians. But to serve on
Turkish triremes when they were warring against the Christiane
would be to assist directly in doing wrong, and it has been so char·
acterized by the canon law. Carrying arms to the Turks would not 89
be a direct wrong nor a wrong at all in this sense, to adopt the dis·
tinctions which these very writers make in following others. Have
not the Turks today various wars amongst themselves, waged both
at the gates of the city and against the Persians? Now, to carry
such articles to the Turks as will be very probably used against the
Turks is not forbidden, “for no one questions the lawfulness of
helping infidels against infidels, as Navarrus and another very learned
Spanish scholar, Molina, remark. Christians may light with the

t Turks against those who are not Christians, Navarrus says, and
he remarks that we are within the law in helping them against other
Turks. Consequently the possibility that the Turk might use these
munitions against the Christians is very remote indeed, for he is
rather far away lrom the Christiane of that region where this ship

was or was going to be, and very far away lrom the Spaniards.
Besides, in this case we can defend the opinion of those who have
always said that a penalty is not incurred if these things are carried
with no intent of furthering an attack on Christians. The words of ·
the canon law indicate this, and Navarrus adds what has Just been
said about assistance, although writers commonly oller another in-
terpretation of this law. We ought not to depart more and still
