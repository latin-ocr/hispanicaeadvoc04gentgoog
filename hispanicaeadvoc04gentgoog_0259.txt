CHAPTER XXVIII
Ol an Exception Based on Nullity
TO THE SAME PERSON

Ι have said that the decree which has been given to cover the
handing over of eight chests of sugar to the Dutchman is null and
void for various reasons, and l have said so in accordance with the
law. ⁸Let me say that a verdict is null and void which has a mani·
fest error either in itself or in its relation to the procedure. Now, the
decree has the error that it orders chests which do not exist to be
handed over, anda decree which covers something else than has been “
asked lor is null and void. It covers the handing over of such 232

the matter discussed in a full inquiry‚ to have parties frequently
interrogatcd, to have other things done, and the failure to do
these things proves the haste Ι speak of. That verdict is null and
void which favors the Dutchman, when he does not have a man·
date. Let the mandate be shown, if there is one, that this Dutchman
is to take legal action against the ambassador of the King, or the
other necessary documents. tlNullity resulting from a iailure to
produce a mandate is always urged even after a verdict has been
given. Thus there are several points which would show the nullity
oi this verdict. Ι 3311 31313 decree, which partakes more ο1 3133 char·
