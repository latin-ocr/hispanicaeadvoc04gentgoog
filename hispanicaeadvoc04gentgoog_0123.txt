The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 97

Furthermore, we must not say that our sovereign‚ the King ol
Great Britain, with an endless state ol hostility on the part ol the Span-
iards going on, would have wished the trade ol his subjects, important
as it is, to be disturbed forever. Bitter would be such servitude;
harsh, the interpretation, and not to be accepted. The interpreta-
tion would not be the same for both parties, lor our sovereign, the
King ol Great Britain, has no perpetual enemies3 he and the Turks
follow principles ol law in matters ol trade. '⁰‘ But the interpreta-
tion should be followed, by way ol restriction and extension, which
keeps the burdens equal, takes equally into account the interest ol
both contracting parties, andis the less prejudicial to one ol them.
Now, cases of this sort are numerous and common in the writings of
our doctors‚ and admit ol no question.

But if you say that at the present time the Spaniards are actually
at war with the Turks, since the Turks are waging war with the
Emperor, the relative and supportet ol the King ol Spain, and on
the borders of the Spanish home-lands, the reply to the point is
easy: The Emperor was the first to begin this war against the Turks
which has been going on for the last thirty years without any inter-
ruption; furthermore, the principles of law governing the Emperor
do not apply to the King; '⁷ finally, kinship, which is a matter ol
private interest, surely does not concern public affairs. Besides, the
naming of the Emperor among the supporters of the Spaniard counts
for nothing in this case. Surely this lact is not to be taken seriously,
but it is a kind ol formula to satisly time-honored procedure and to
give expression to good-will. Now, how can practically all the same
people be named as supporters on both sides without making this a
mere formula ol procedure? People who have not given support in
time ol war cannot properly be named among one's supporters. The
Emperor did not support the Spaniard in the war which was carried on
between the English and the Spaniards: for instance, the Emperor and
Elizabeth always observed the rights of friendship during the war;
and the same Emperor has even been named among his supporters
by our King. Besides, think of those who are called supporters,
who have neither named themselves nor ratified their nomination
by the high contracting parties. They are not bound by the articles
ol the treaty; therefore, others are not bound either. This is the

reply which Angelus makes on the subject ,Of ratification, and the
principle is undoubtedly sound.

Of less than no account is the statement that war is going on over
the home-landa ol the Spaniard, lor the lands over which the Em·
peror and the Turk are at war cannot be called Spanish except by
remote anticipation. ¹¹¹ What is neither possessed nor controlled by the
Spaniard is not called Spanish. Μ’ We scarcely call the father's
