be delayed even when it injures the right ol the third party? This
is what Cravetta responds and what Covarruvias thinks, and no·
body has expressed a dillerent opinion. iWhen a verdict does not
injure, a third party who is concerned may come lorward and make
opposition after execution has begun. But here it does injure.
¹‘In a case ol doubt a verdict should be so interpreted as to
injure less the third party-so as not to injure him at all. But here
we are notin doubt, since we have accepted opinions. ¹Accepted
opinions do not leave the matter in doubt, but make it clear, mor
il we follow arguments of the sort [made by our opponents]‚ surely
nothing will have been so clear that it cannot be obscured. ln addi·
183 tion l shall make short work ol the argument here, that il one ought
to pass judgment in this way in a case of doubt, so that a verdict
may not injure a third party, for the reason that this would be the less
injurious course, by affirming that on that ground the execution ol
the res iudicata in this suit lor possession will not be hindered to our
prejudice, because it is this that would be the less injurious course.
Without violating any of the rights ol our adversaries, execution
can be made for us. n To delay it is a matter ol no ordinary preju-
dice. This is a serious matter and ol public importance, that the au-
thority ol res iudicatae should be frustrated in this way. ⁰ Even when
prejudice has not been done to a third party, still it does not follow
from that that execution should nothe made. ⁹Now, in this case
slight knowledge is enough when a third party resists the execution
ol a verdict, since his right in respect to the property has been
observed in an ordinary trial. sln this case our adversaries ought to
be condemned, and condemned to pay the costs of the entire action
against the navigator. They have allowed the ambassador to he
tired out by the navigator, and now they come forward to bring ac-
tion on their own account concerning the same matter. This prin·
ciple is thoroughly accepted, says Ancharanus, in order that in this
way we may check the spiteful acts of individuals and needless ex-
pense. Cravetta holds the same view also, noting that an opportu-
nity to transgress would be allorded by the judge, if an execution
should be hindered in this fashion, lor others in their reliance on a
precedent ol this sort would contrive similar cunning devices. rExe-
cution is not hindered because an action has been moved and exception
made which requires somewhat carelul investigation.
