The Pleas of a Spanisfr Advocato, Bk. l. 91

it, suffer the same penalty. The phrase does not referto those who
merely know. Now, there are certain cases in which the mere knowl-
edge of an offense prejudices your case. Among these this case of
ours is not mentioned in the books, as appears from Menochius,
who recounts them. Consequently‚ uas our writers usually argue,
this case would not fall among those. But could our opponents show
in this case any knowledge of the unlawful goods on the part of the
English who were owners of the lawful goods, and could they main·
tain that this is one of those cases where merc knowledge prejudices
one's cause? Therefore, Ι conclude my argument concerning lawful
goods with confidente, xforthere is nothing in lmola’s opinion. He
thinks that the laws which mention the smuggling of dutiable goods 86
and enact that non-dutiable goods are not subject to fine or confisca-
tion do not apply particularly to the case of lawful and unlawful
goods carried together, and, therefore, the parallel fails, and lawful
goods may be subject to confiscation, as the doctors maintain. This
difficulty of Imola Ι would resolve by simply saying that all the other
doctors hold and set forth the opposite view. However, other reasons
also which I have given elsewhere, and which the doctors give, go to
prove the accepted view.

Now l come to the second point which in general would go to
protect even the said unlawful merchandisc. The English were cap·
tured en route, before they reached the place whence, as Cynus says,
they could not turn back. Therefore, the property is not subject to
confiscation, because they could return and repent, as Cynus teaches
in commenting on unlawful merchandisc. They could refuse to sell ,
at Constantinople, or tell me, who would have forced them to sell?
ylndeed in commenting on the aforementioned laws of my oppon·
ents, the learned Suarczius ina case like this one of ours makes this
plea in defense of a Genoese ship which likcwisc went to the lands of
the Saracens with arms and other contraband goods, and was cap·
tured on the way. ‘⁸ lf anyone shall have sold,” says the law. No·
tice that it requires a completed act. The other laws too call for the
completion of the act, as we sce in Suarczius. ²Thus in the case of
the statute which forbids the exportation of grain or anything else,
the law is the basis of the common opinion that the statute and the
penalty imposcd by the statute take effect when the article has been
exportcd, not while it is being exported and is on the way. My posi·
tion is not wcakened if in connection with this statute a usage is ,
urged contrary to the opinion of the expounders of the law, since a
usage would have to be proved, for the establishment of which at
the most we trust the testimony of learned men only for the places
and times in which they lived. To be sure, the cautious Clarus him· 87
self speaks to this effect: ‘⁴ With us the practice is observcd with·
