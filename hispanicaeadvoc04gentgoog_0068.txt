by the fact ¹that to oller oneself as a soldier may be an ollense and
that it may not be of importance that a man's name has not been set
down on the rolls, as Trajan wrote in reply to a doubt raised by
Pliny, for in that connection this emperor expresses the opposite
opinion, namely that the day on which the soldier takes the military

40 oath and is accepted, makes him reveal the reality of his motive. Note,
too, that these soldiers of ours have not yet been accepted. And so,
you see, there are two arguments in support of our position.

Now, the third argument is like the second, that, where action
is called for, intention and potentiality do not suffice, “as Jason·
formulates and develops the rule. But without doubt aetion is
called for, that isto say, one should be an enemy in action that he
may be punished as an enemy. Of course, punishment is a prejudicial
thing. Consequently, what is stated in that connection in the case
of actuality, will not be accepted in the case of potentiality.

The fourth argument has to do with a similar point: ¹¹ that a ἡ
man found to be in a house for the purpose of committing theft
cannot be punished for theft, if he has not yet begun to appropriate
anything, lor appropriation is the essence of theft. So in this case
these people must have begun to serve under the enemy, if they are to
be called enemies. Nor would it suffice, if they had even reached the
enemy’s land, for at the'present stage they cannot be put to death
there as enemies, and surely they cannot be put to death on any other
basis, for on no other basis are they enemies,

οΑ fifth argument is drawn from the fact that Baldus and all the
others maintain in very strong terms that a man under sentence may
not be punished after a verdict has been given from which an appeal
has been taken, or even from which an appeal has not been taken,
provided the time limit for an appeal has not expired.

¹’The sixth argument is to the ellect that, under the statute which
calls for the life of him who has inflicted a mortal wound upon another,
a man who has inllicted a mortal wound upon another cannot be ac·
cused and convicted of homicide, unless death follows, even if it be
certain that the wounded man is going to die from the wound.

Now, this part of the discussion which rests upon rules and is
supported by that first very strong argument will be happily rounded
out, if l reply to those opposing arguments. Therefore, the first
three points—they are one in reality-present no difficulty, because
in the prejudicial matter of a punishment, what has been stated in these

41 arguments does not apply. qSo in the case of a licentiate, a distinc-
tion is made, and the equitable view is held that in prejudicial mat·
ters he is not rated as a doctor. ‘Similarly if one kill a person
elected to a bishopric, he is not punished as if he were to kill a
bishop. Of this character are many other cases. Therefore, 'Jason
