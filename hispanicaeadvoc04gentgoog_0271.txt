tion applied in practice, when it is true that the parties concerned in
the sale were in harmony concerning the article and the price, but
said, “We will make the instrument tomorrow.'’ Do they seem by
using words of this sort to have wished to complete the contract
of sale in writing? The result is important, he says, because in the
meantime they would have an opportunity to change their minds, since 245
the contract cannot be thought of as linished until after the instru-
ment has been published. But he concludes that it is not a contract
in writing on account of the aforesaid reasoning of Salycetus, and
because otherwise the contracting parties would be inconsistent in
having linished the contract of sale by a simple agreement, and then
in having canceled it, by postponing the matter to the following day.
This is weak reasoning, and begs the question with reference to the
completion of a contract, although this case is not the same as that
of Decianus, about which we are talking here, nor is it the same as
was that of Butrigarius, or of Faber, or the other. They are not
dealing with cases where the instrument is made while the agreeing
or contracting-such are the terma employed ιη drawing up an in·
strument-is in the process of making, but where the instrument is

made subsequent to the contract. But Barbatia says that be carried
the day in that case of his. Furthermore, Decianus cites in addition

¹'Fabianus as well as Afflictis, and consequently Afflictis is inconsis-
tent, since he is cited to the opposite effect by Decius. Decianus quotes
Angelus too, who thought that the parties concerned seemed to wisb

to have the contract published in a written form in the specilic case
when they say that it would not otherwise hold, unless set down in Ἰ
writing. This is the same kind of false reasoning, for his opponents
will say that the argument counts in their bebalf, so that, if the con·
tract were in writing, it would also be conditional, pendings tmper-
fect, until a written statement of rt has been made. But the converse

of their argument, that, if rt were not in writing, it would not be a

pending one either, would not hold.
He cites also Franciscus Aretinus, who replies to the dicta of

Castrensis and says that he observes the common usage and practice
to the ellect that, although an agreement may be reached to call tn a
notary, still for that reason the document would not be called a con·
tract made m writing, but only a paper by way of proof. Decianus
himself adds thatin reality he today sees such a usage and practice
everywhere followed. On this point Ι would remark that the 246
doctor who testilies about the usage outside of the district where he
bas lived ought not to be trusted, indeed, that tt is not even clear
whether such a doctor ought ever to be trusted. ‘¹In fact, a
number of writers hold this view, and testify that it is the common
opinion that he should not be trusted, except percbance in the case of
