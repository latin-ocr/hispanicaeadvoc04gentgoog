CHAPTER XVII 72

On Various Questions, Addressed to the Illustriousllurisconsult,
Robert Taylor

You ask me, honored sir, to tell you in a word what the law ¹

is in the questions which you lay before me, not because I am the
more learned, but because l am a less busy man than you. Ἰ reply
that the most commonly accepted view is, thatin criminal cases a judge
may not admit the defendant to bail. There is no doubt at all con·
. cerning this view in the case of more serious crimes, whatever
Menochius and Suarezius may say to the contrary. bThose who
have committed a serious crime are not released on bail, as the law
itself says. Yet this law puts it at the discretion of the judge to
decide what constitutes a serious crime. ⁰ But if even a slave charged
with a capital ollense can be admitted to bail, the privilege has to do
with chains from which he may be set free by bail, buthe may not be
released from prison. “chains are a very dillerent thing from im·
prisonment or confinement, Duarenus says on this point. As to the
use of chains, that is, asto imposing them on a slave and requiring
him to plead his cause in them, it is a special practice in the case of a
slave, eas other writers note from a study of this law. Menochius
is wrong in attacking Angelus on these points. f The other law, which
does not require the holding in custody even of those who are with·
out bondsmen‚ gives no indication of the practice for the more se·
rious crimes. But the practice will be made clear by what has been
said above. So much on the first question, and set forth a little more
fully, l think, than you wished.
On the second point, with reference to the meaning of the words
“about to take cate '' (daturos operam), which are given somewhat
A brielly in the peace articles, ⁸“to take care '’ means to desire, to
strive, and to look after. hSallust remarks aptly on the well-known
decree of the senate that the “consuls should take care ” (darent
operam consules), that by this measure unlimited power is granted, so
that we may therefore assert that in this case we have the greatest care 73
guaranteed by the direct promise of kings, as well as by the binding
nature of society, to which this contract embodied in treaties is
similar and of which it is a part. iHe who promises that he will
exerc himself ought to act in good faith, so far as is in him. He
ought to exert himself with all earnestness without being solicited to
