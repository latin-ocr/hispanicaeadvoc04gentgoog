The Pleas of a Spanisb Advocato, Bk. l. 31

passage before us Archidiaconus discourses in this fashion. Or if the
man who speaks in this way does state any conclusion, he does so,
as I have said, in his last utterance. ”¹³ Panormitanus makes the same
observation in discussing an opinion of Innocent‚ even when Innocent
stated a second view in these words: “But others give a contrary
opinion.” ⁰⁰ However, these words do not usually convey the view of
the man who speaks, even if they stand at the end of his discussion. But
this would be the case, when an earlier view was in the main supported.
Other things being equal, the last statement is to be accepted.
‘²⁶ Upon another remark made by Baldus, Rolandus put it cleverly
that Baldus does not seem to support this view: on the other hand,
Rolandus reports at the end 01 his argument that the doctors hold the
same view, indeed hold this very opinion which he thus gives at the
end. Rolandus also says that reliance ought not to be put on certain
remarks of Jason, who depends on the dictum of another person,
since the other person expressly holds the opposite view. e‘These
cases are undoubtedly very frequent. Of a certain gloss, Felynus
writes: “ “The whole world cites it: yet it rather proves the opposite
point, because it directly establishes the contrary view, and holds fast
to this contrary view.” Shall we not say the same thing of the passage
of Archidiaconus before us? “To state frankly what Ι think,’' says
Oddus, “I have been surprised at the doctors who cite Baldus to this
effect, etc.’' “And in another case, Menochius, in opposing Decius, '
Parisios, Socinus‚ Vasquinus, and Covarruvias, says: “Itis surely
remarkable that these famous expounders of the law have arrived at
this conclusion so rashly, without weighing properly the passages

. cited by them.'' And in this way Menochius shows that their authori·
tias lare yotlpertinent. And so it stands with Archidiaconus and bis
w oesc oo.

F urthermore, Oldradus does not seem, if be be carefully studied,
to make that statement, and this Socinus likewise maintains, ¹²¹² for
Oldradus says: “What 01 the man who has been seized and is being
led through a churchr suppose that he is dragged out (note Aren.. 30
17, qu. 4, sicut antiquitus²).” And similarly he expresses himself
in a supplementary note to the consilium, as it were heedlessly, and not
with regard 1ο the case covered by the consilium. “A statement which
is made carelessly is not the real view 01 1 1101101. These state-
ments in fact apply also to Albericus, Caepolla, and to other writers,
the more so to Decianus, since he wrote in this fashion in that
handbook 01 his, a work brought out after his death, unrevised and
incomplete, a book in which he does not mention Clarus and the
other writers l have cited as being opposed to the view of Archidia-
conus. ¹¹² Clarus is a man of great discernment; he is accurate in mak-

ing quotations, and 1 1101101 01 sound learning.
