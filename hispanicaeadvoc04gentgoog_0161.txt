The Pleas of a Spanislr Advocata Bk. ll. 13 ς

grow pale, and indeed, although they are speaking the truth, they
hesitate, they support themselves on something, they measure all
their words, as everybody should who regards the sacred character
of testimony and the sense of honor attaching to it. They know
what the force, what the authority, what the weight oi this whole
matter is. The rest, with no regard to all these consideratione, un·
mindlul of religion, indillerent to the deity, are in no wise influenced
in giving evidence, even when it is thoroughly false. To this effect
Cicero speaks oi both these classes of people in two orations.

Now, let the reply to the fourth argument be that a written dis·
course is not the worked over one to which the law objects in
the case oi witnesses. Objection is made to that discourse which has
been composed by several witnesses so that all of them may seem to 133
be in harmony and speaking the truth. Consequently, the law does not
speak at all oi one witness, but ol several witnesses: ‘⁴ Whether they
have submitted one and the same prepared statement.” A prepared
statement ol another sort would not be objected to. The binding
character of an oath, the authority which testimony has, call for it.
“ Remember, judges, with what labor you are in the habit of exert-
ing yourselves not only as to what you may say by way ol evidence,
but even what words you may use, etc.,” as one reads in the same
writer, Tullius, in his oration ior Fonteius. ‘³⁴³ Our writers even say
also that a witness who speaks fluently is presumed to be suborned. Still
I do not fail to notice Budaeus’ note to Accursius in that connection
on the word “extemporaneously” contained in the law. But the
law, with the interpretation ol Budaeus, disapproves of a witness
basing his replies on a note book; it does not object to prepared
testimony. The judge may interrogate this witness, if he wishes;
he will reply extemporaneously3 this questioning the opinion of Bar·
tolus presupposes. The witness appearing in person with a docu-
ment has communicated his willingness to repeat everything in a
new examination, and by word ol mouth. Here the judge‚ to my
advantage, may have recourse to Decianus, who reaches the conclu·
sion that when a judge can recall a witness ol this sort and remove
this obstacle he ought surely to do so (ethis opinion also other
writers have previously held), since the judge, so far as he can, ought
to help build up, not avertam, prools.

The reply to the fifth argument, that of Aretinus, is that he is
speaking oi the case ol an absent person. Dillerent is the case oi a
person who, though present, has to make the accusation likewise in a
document. Thereiore, a witness is not comparable with him, lora
witness does not have to give testimony with such formality. Ι sup·
ppse this situation also results from the favor shown to the giving
,o evidence.
