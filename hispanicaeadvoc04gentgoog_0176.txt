CHAPT ER VI
Of Unsupported Wienesses and the Proof of a Storm

‘To use the words of the most learned Decianus, Ι say briefly,
coming directly to the point, that unsupported witnesses furnish a
proof in those cases which are difficult to prove, and the laclr of
support is not a difficulty, but an clement of strength, as when a
single person furnishes proof of a confession made to him in one
place, and another person furnishes proof of another confession
made to him in another place. Those facts which can be established
by several witnesses from occurrences which fit together are not
established by unsupported witnesses; but the acts, which, because
they are forbidden, everybody strives with all his ability and with
various precautions and tricks to cover up, are proved by unsup-
ported witnesses. These and other points in Decianus. lIndications,
inferences, and presumptions are in this case considered true and
conclusive proofs, and half complete and imperfect proofs are joined
to form a complete and perfect proof. clndeed, according to the

146 several kinds ol business the law has introduced several methods of
proof, and it has not wished to limit the range of proofs. dOthers
also, not mentioned by Decianus, teach that a confession is proved by
unsupported witnesses; ethat we believe evidence which tends to a
single conclusion; ¹ that we believe the evidence, if other inferences
concur. There are other points, all of which count for us in this
case.

So, even unsupported witnesses will prove in our behall that

- the captain of the ship did not seriously try to put in at the island
of St. Michael, beyond which putting in had been forbidden, while
one witness says that there was definite conversation on the ship
about a voyage straight to Holland. Furthermore, the other says
that there was nota storrn to keep them from the island. And the
captain, how does he prove the existence of this storm? “There is
no doubt that he who relies upon a negative has to prove the nega·
tive, and that he who alleges an obstacle has to prove its existence by
acting and facing it. ¹²The never failing rule is that he who depends
on a negative should prove it. The rule also is that the proof of a
negative should be reached by a careful examination. Therefore
witnesses, even when not summoned, have to furnish a reason which
is fully and necessarily conclusive.
