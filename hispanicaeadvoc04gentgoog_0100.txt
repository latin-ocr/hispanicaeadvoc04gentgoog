74 Alberico Genua·

are all superfluous in our controversy, since the King's edict is seen
to be clear regarding the time, and likewise regarding the civil re-
sponsibility imposed upon those unaware of the edict. The King
had the power to make the law operative, not after several months,
but at once, ⁸as Menochius recently decided, and he went fully and
in detail into this discussion of the time within which a law is bind-
ing upon subjecte.

The more difficult question remains for us of deciding how
we are to take the words of the edict and of the treaty which com-

70 mand that account be taken of what is captured after that day. We
must examine the words as found in the treaty recently made with
Spain, since the King's will is less carefully expressed in the edict.
¹²Now, perhaps these words mean that answer must be given in
court and that these subsequent captures must be justified. This is
the sense in which Decius and Ruinus understand the article of the
agreement between the Genoese and Savoyards, in which it is stated
that the Savoyards are bound to give account at Genoa, and this
they maintain means to submit to trial at Genoa. And truly what
else can the words mean? iTo render account is to balance receipts
and expenditures, not merely to pay the dillerence, which may be
nothing. The words by no means appear to condemn. Η* Account ”
in this connection would imply “ discriminating examination of the
motive and justification of the act performed.’' Thus others put it.
And this discrimination would point to the discretioir of a good man,
and the account would be such as would not suller the act to be nulli·
fied. ¹Then, too, they express the opinion that ‘⁴ answer” would
mean “to appear,‘' not “to pay.'’ ΙΙΙΑςαὶῐι, theologians in com·
menting on the saying, “They shall give an account of every idle
word,’'² explain that itis really not the same as the other one,
“ Depart‚ ye cursed,‘’ ¹ and that the fault permits of atonement. ”And
further, the words of the peace articles would be rather numerous
and obscure, if their intent was that booty captured after the day
mentioned should be arbitrarily returned.

Now, with reference to the articles, l consider three cases here:
First, where the act occurred prior to the day hxed; second, where
the act occurred after theday when peace was concluded; third,
where the act occurred between these two time limits. In the first
case l see the privateers in perfect safety; in the second, in utter inse·
curity; in the third, which is our case, in utter uncertainty. Thus the
articles prescribe that after the conclusion of peace no booty at all
be taken, which is the second case. Thus they prescribe that nothing
done before the appointed day should be brought under the law,
