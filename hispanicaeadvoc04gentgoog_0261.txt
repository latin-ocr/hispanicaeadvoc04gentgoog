The Pleas of a Spanisl Advocato, Bk. II. 235

⁹A vcrdict which is null and void cannot be confirmed. Furthermore‚
a subsequent verdict, which has confirmed the one mentioned, is null
and void, and that point about the error in the marks is not the only
one which rendere this verdict null and void, as has been said. His
Lordship, our judge‚ who is an ordinary judge‚ clearly like an ordi·
nary judge‚ can take this matter up for judgment again, and conse·
quently‚ he may take it up again. But let him listen to us il he does
not wish again to make a decision which is null and void. qAn
exception, based on nullity, is not properly an exception. Therefore,
itis always ollered in opposition‚ even when every exceptionis for·
bidden, and no preceding decree strengthens it, nor does the confession
ol a party concerned, although the efficacy ol a confession is so great
that a judge may lawfully pass from any stupid process of law what·
ever to any penalty whatsoeyer, even to the penalty of death.
