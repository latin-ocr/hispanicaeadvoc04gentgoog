there is presumption ol bad saith, the third party will not hinder the
execution, as the common opinion goes, evenis proof be ollered at
once, as Felynus teaches, in following others. οΙη support of the
same conclusion 1 add Alexander, Jason, Cravetta3 and in the latter's
writings another authority is named to the same ellect. Nor does
Decius in his responsas take the side oi Panormitanus, who teaches the
contrary doctrine in the supplement added to his treatise. ”Decius
in view of tbe reasons advanced for hesitating and for not settling the
matter, holds to the earlier opinion oi Panormitanus which supports
156 the other side. He does not, however, reply on the decisive point,
since, without refuting Panormitanus, he had another sure reply to
make, because in his case prool could not have been given at once.
qln his lectures Decius stands vigorously for Panormitanus, and yet

‘he urges no argument in support oi Panormitanus.

He does not even reply to the first, most convincing argument of
Alexander, the only argument which Felynus sets down, and which

- Jason asserta is a good one. It is this: When proof is required at
once, the ollering oi it accomplishes nothing further3 but proof is
required at once to delay an execution3 therefore, the ollering of it
will not also eliminate the presumption ol bad saith. l am sur·
prised that Covarruvias, who also inclines to the view of Panormi·
tanus, says that Decius has replied to Alexander. Decius replies,
or tries to reply, to the other reasons of Alexander, but to the reason

’ given above he does not even breathe a word.

· The reason given above is also confirmed in this case of posses·
sion ol ours, 'in which, as involving an execution, prools offered at
once are especially required to delay the execution. 'To delay an
execution proof is required at once, but in particular to delay an
execution in a case ol possession. Now, two arguments, like chains,
hold them last. Will the offering of proof even yet remove these
two and remove besides the presumption of bad saith?

The point which Decius urges about another argument of Alex-
ander which he turns against its author is also groundless, for it does
not follow, if the case of the robber would be a special one, because
the hatred felt for him preventa us from listening even to what he
wishes to prove at once -it does not follow that the procedure would
be the reverse in the case of one acting in bad saith. Indeed, Alex·
ander says properly that if this is true of the robber it ought to be
true also of one who acts in bad faith, for each of them is thoroughly
detested. Still I do not set about examining this point more thor·

157 oughly. It is enough that Decius brings nothing in support of the
opinion of Panormitanus, and nothing against the very strong argu-
ment of Alexander. I am surprised that Covarruvias also cites In· l

nocent ‘in support oi Panormitanus, and yet that in his entire dis·
