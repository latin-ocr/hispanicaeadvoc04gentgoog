Angelus expresses himself. tSo also Bellus3 for what, says he, if the
enemy lie hidden in the woods or elsewhere with booty for three or
four days while he lacks the power to return to his own people? ¹⁸ To
the same eflect the most learned Molina. He interprets fortilied lines
as a wall or a camp. He expresses himself even rnore fully to the
eflect that it does not cover the case if the captives spend a night
with the enemy or are brought into the camp, provided the owners

keep up the pursuit, and do not give up their ellorts to recover their
goods. For in this case they would lose neither the right of owner·
ship nor of possession.

The Spaniards have not lost possession in this case since their
goods were not put into the enemy’s vessel‚ but were left in the captured
ship, which was towed‚ or was navigated by the Dutch who were trans·
ferred to it. ⁸ Furthermore, the owner, even when he hasbeen ejected,
retains possession through his representative who has not been ejected
but is even detained against his wish. And this was the situation in this
case where captive Spaniards remained in a captured vessel‚ for by
means of these captive sailors and these agents the owners of the goods

9 retained their property and the right of possession. yNor would
they lose possession, even if their representative should give it up.
'Provided they were themselves detained, they would be regarded at
least as dispossessed. But we are rather discussing ownership at
present. Besides, Molina points out very pertinently to our maritime

four hours seems enough to some people, still, if the incident takes
place at sea we may not think of the property as acquired by the
enemy who takes it until it has been brought to a safe place. And
indeed the line of reasoning in the case of maritime affairs, as Ι
have set it forth for this case of ours, is somewhat different.
“Finally Ayala also is on our side. Hear what he says: “ Still
this point must be recognized,'’ he says, “ that booty does not become
the property of the enemy until the time arrives when it has first been
brought within fortified lines.” “Up to that time it has not be·
corne the enemy's, nor has it ceased to belong to the man who had ’
owned it.” bbl too have written to this ellect in my books on war,
and Ι have not now made the statement for the first time, and for·
sooth Ι have asserted it in a word, as an undoubted fact. And so all
the authorities are on our side, none on the side of Gama.

Or do the following statements which we quote from Angelus
support Gama? ‘⁰⁸‘ But if the said booty, though it be not sent
back within the fortified lines, be kept in the camp for so long a
period, that in all probability he who has lost it must have given up
the intention of recovering it, we may understand that he has really
lost it. But in deciding how much time ought to elapse, in order that
