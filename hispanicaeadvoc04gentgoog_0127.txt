The Pleas ol a Spanist Advocate, Bk. I. 101

ol the common law an enemy obtains a legal title to a thing when he
has captured it and kept it ior a night, while according to civil jurists
he has first to bring it clear through to a point within his lortified
lines. Or, 11 these laws are in harmony, then what is decided by the
specialists in the civil law will be understood as likewise decided by 98

the specialists in the common law. Why then, pray, should the latter
be convoked and wearied to no purpose, or rather, with the danger
that a right decision be destroyed through discord, or a wrong deci·
sion be not corrected through discord also. t'To no purpose is that
done by many which can be done by lew. Badly is a thing done by
difficolt means, when it can be done by easy means. Therefore the
method which opens the way ior these inconvenient wrangles should
not be adopted. But to join together the professors 01 these two kinds
ο1 law, which is the method now proposed, opens the way for these
inconvenient wrangles. Therefore this method should not be adopted.
We could not have expected as bitter quarrels from those schools ο1
the ancients filled with the followers 01 Proculus and Sabinus respec-
tively, ⁰by whom Justinian declares that almost all law was thrown
into confusion, as we may expect from these schools 01 civil and com·
mon law in England. Ο1 course the ancients had one source and one
basic principle, but we and these pettifoggers on the other side have
different and even conflicting basic principles. Woe to the party that
shall litigate here before varying judges and under laws that are not
in harmony. What, pray, may the man who received a favorable
decision in the lirst instance expect but a decision against him; and a
man who got an unfavorable verdict in the first instance, what may
he expect but a lavorable one? And here will merely this system
in practice be urged against me to show that this inconvenience does
not follow, as my line of argument would lead us to'expecti Now, l
shall hear 01 and learn that usage, 11 l can, but meanwhile a sound
argument proves it to be, as we have said, 01 decided inconvenience.
The third argument will be that the English common law is not
suitable to be used in meting out justice to foreigners. The English
civil law would be more suitable. What has the common law 01 Eng·
land to do “with them that are without? ” ² It lacks the intent, it lacks 99
the power, it lacks the language to deal with them. Come, show the
statute of this law which would give the formula lor a transaction,
in Spain, say, between a Frenchman andan Italian, so that 11 judicial
proceedings with reference to the transaction were to be instituted
here in England‚ judgment might even be given in accordance with
the actual law of England. 1’The court ordinances 01 the law 01
England shall be preserved in England‚ but the determining principles
shall be sought elsewhere, ior the discriminating method, which would
