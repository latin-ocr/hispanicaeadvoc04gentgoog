The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. ll. 211

tion in order to harmonize opinions; because, when the appeal is
against the formos the common law, it should not be admitted in a
doubtful case, and thus the former view would have the right of way:
but if a reason should be added for the special granting of an appeal‚
then appeal should be allowed and the latter opinion would have 209
the right ol way. This is the distinction which former writers would
not deny, nor do we deny it. But our question belongs to the former

case· ln reply to the second point, regarding less prejudice, we say

that it is avicious statement in the present question because not even
trifling prejudice is caused by the victor, or il there was any,·still
what the statutos and common law give him should not be taken
from him lor the simple reason that it harms the other party or causes
him greater prejudice. u He does not cause an injury who is exercis-
ing his own rights.

As to the third and last argument of Contardus, I may say in
the first place that every question or action concerning possession
is, and is regarded by the law as, of a provisional nature, as was set
forth above at the beginning, and that this distinction between con·
tinuous and temporary possession is not found anywhere‚ and cs·
pecially not in this case oi ours. Again‚ my opponents should give
prooi that they are not presuming that a decision was given other
than that regarding possession and the case of the moment; lor we
simply brought a suit ior possession; their own decision awarded us
the possession. Now, every action for possession relates to the pres·
ent moment, as already said, and ¹¹ the decision is understood to be ¹
in harmony with the libel and is issued in harmony with the libel.
Further, the intention of the judge in giving his decision was, as all
understood it, ”¹¹¹² to have it in harmony with the libel, in accord·
ance with which it has to be interpreted, so that the action
may stand and not perish. This is the' more to be approved
because that whole remedy of devolution, which they derive from
the ingenuity oi the doctors‚ has not been introduced in accordance
with the law or the statutes, and, consequently, in cases and remedies
that relate to possession above all other cases there should be the
least place for it, especially where the decision given dealt with the
suit lor possession alone, and does not involve in addition a suit for
ownership, as mentioned above, nor one for securing the income 210
therelrom, ”2 in which case, again, the doctors commonly think that
an appeal from the decision in the suit ior possession should be
granted, just as it should in the case of a suit for possession involving
the question oi ownership.
