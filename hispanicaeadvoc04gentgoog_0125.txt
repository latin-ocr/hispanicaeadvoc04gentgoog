On Holdinq to thr civit 1,ἕῖ in illppeals from ci Judqe of the

The question is whether those who profess the English common
law· ought to be among the appellate judges when an appeal is taken
from a judge of the Admiralty, or whether those alone should be
appointed who profess the English civil law. For so l distinguish
the two kinds of law. l do not call the one English law and the
other Roman, for in a sovereign state there is no law but that of the
state itself, ‘and those who say otherwise speak incorrectly. Now
I thought the opposing view was helped hythe consideration that it
may be regarded as indisputable that note should be taken of the
common law also in this court of the Admiralty, and that, in conse·
quence, those versed in that law should sit as judges in the court
mentioned. Then, too, we appear to have a weighty consideration in
the fact that in the Admiralty Court the judge is ordered to give
his decisione, so runs the royal letter, according to “ our ” law, under
which designation is understood not the English civil, but rather the
English common law. ι’Το this effect write the commentators on'
the civil law themselves, expressly with reference to the letter of the
English King. Then what of the fact that the custom is believed to
obtain of having the judges for hearing appeals here taken from
those versed in either law at the discretiori of the person who has to
'appoint those judges, ⁴²and these same writers of ours hold that in
a question of interpreting a usage, and the royal letter may be re· 96
garded as interpreting one, a single occurrence of the act in the given
way is sufficient. But a usage both establishing and destroying prece·
dent would be presented, if we should have the repeated appointment
of some professore of this common law as judges. Such are the con·
siderations that occurred to me in favor of this promiscuous selection
of judges. But since these and similar points present no real objec-
tion to my position, Ι think that in this case those only should be
appointed as judges who, like the judge of the Admiralty himself,
are professors of English civil law.

My reason for holding this opinion is that appellate judges have
to consider whether the first judge decided rightly, a question which
must be decided on the basisof· the law according to which he had
to render an opinions and thislaw is precisely that which hc professes,
