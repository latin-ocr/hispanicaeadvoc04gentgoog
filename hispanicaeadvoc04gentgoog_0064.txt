5which speak for themselves, and there is no need here for the ruling
of a judge. l maintain that just as it obtains in postliminium, it
would hold good likewise in the jurisdiction of another, and that on
entering it, they [the prisoners] would be safe from violence. And this
jurisdiction it was the duty of the magistrate to defend, 'else it
would have appeared to his own great detriment that he had ap·
proved of what seemed a private jail. For it did seem like a private
jail, when the Dutch detained Spanish prisoners within the territory
of our King. Therefore, our magistrate was justified in suppressing
unjust violence and punishing it. “Officials who do not check at·
tempted forbidden acts suller punishment. Then, too, how does it
concern the prisoners, if someone or other has ollered violence to the
Dutch?

lb “ If you were to dispossess me of property by violence and
thereupon Titius should take possession of it, I cannot enter an
injunction against anyone but you. If a bandit should drive the
holder and usufructuary from his farm, and on that account the
usufructuaty should not make use of the time fixed upon and thus
lose his rights, no one doubts that the owner, whether he joined the
usufructuary in an action against the bandit or did not so do, would
have a right to retain the usufruct thus reverting to himself, and
that what the usufructuary lost would be at the expense of that man
by whose act it was lost.” eeAnd to the same effect are other laws
and bits of evidence.

Then, too, that other argument of my opponents about restitu-
tion made to those robbed has nothing in it. The Dutch could have
been molested without prejudice. They did not suller violence; they

ετ were restrained from violence, ⁶⁶ etc. Exceptions such as this to the
rule that the person robbed should receive recompense are frequent
enough, so far is it from being the case that-as my opponents main·
tain—this ought to take place without exception. ‘² Even in the case
of persons brought before the court the officials apply no other prin-
ciple than this de facto extrajudicial one. Let the Dutch, let everyone
enjoy the use of the sea, but without violating the jurisdiction of
another nation. ²¹ Let everyone remember too that there are limits to a
joumey by sea as well as to every other joumey. ⁸³Let them re·
member vthat other things, once undelined, are defined today‚ and that
the distinction made by the law of nations, of eminent domains and

jurisdictions, should be most scrupulously observed.
