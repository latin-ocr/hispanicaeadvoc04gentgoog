CHAPTER VII

Of the Proof of 1 qnoronce ond Knowledqe

The rule 'is that we take for granted, not knowledge, but
ignorance of another’s act, especially if the person attingis a long
way off. bTherefore, knowledge must be established by most cogent
proofs‚ since the rule and presumption of law oppose taking it for
granted. eExact knowledge with all the characteristics peculiar to
that act, full, definite knowledge must be proved. dlgnorance is
proved from the very fact that the contrary is not proved, and thus
there is a new method of establishing a point, as Andreas de Bamlo
says. eBut as an act of supererogation, the other party can prove
his ignorante, and indeed by his own oath, and hemust be listened
to. This is undoubtedly the case.

Still the following principle too would be true that, ‘whether it
be knowledge or ignorance, it must be alleged and proved by him
who bases his purpose, either in suing or in taking an exception,
upon knowledge or ignorante. Thus it is expressly against a third
person opposing a res iudicato that it would be enough to bring
this knowledge up against him, and that he would have to prove
his ignorance. He would be a stupid person who should take an Α
exception against this third party on the score of knowledge, for
in that case he would himself have to prove the knowledge. This
Villapandus, a very learned Spanish jurisconsult, says. Come, act
generously3 prove the knowledge. ¹'It is a well-accepted principle that
knowledge is proved by indications and inferences, by one witness
even, and, therefore, in proving it, it is true that a very exact proof
is required. Indeed, the matter is difficult to prove. Therefore, it
would be proved just like any other matter difficult to prove.

Still, so far as concerns three or four of these people, it is quite
certain that those who were always in the company of the navigator
knew of the whole dispute with the navigator, although they said
nothing. ¹¹It is taken for granted that those who are present know
what is being done on the spot, especially what is being done publicly,
especially what concerns themselves, and especially what lasts long
enough to attract the attention, as is the case bere. iIt is taken for
granted that a serious matter has become known to ‘⁸ everybody'’
whom it can “ in any wisc ” injure. ¹‘Then also itis taken for granted

that those who are absent are informed, owners by their agents, says
