CHAPT ER ΙΙΙ ·
Of Instructed W ltnesses

Itis certain ¹ that witnesses may be induced by entreaties to give
testimony, provided there be no corruption. ιἸιι the same way, too,
it is the instruction of witnesses with a view to corrupting them, not
their instruction by way of warning, that is forbidden. Roffredus
says in his pamphlets, on the title De Senatus Consulto Liboniuno,¹
that a witness instructed by a party to speak the truth would not be
called suborned. Over this dictum Baldus rejoices, as Felynus ob·
serves. ellut Baldus, as Odolredus says, remarks that an advocate 138
ought not to give witnesses wrong instructions, but he easily is able in
good laith to instruct them so that they may know how to speak
the truth, and he adds that be has done tbis many times.

“He too, as well as others, makes the distinction that either the
witness was instructed to make a positive or a negative statement,
when it would be a case of subornation, or else, when the witness
wished to make a positive ora negative statement, he was instructed
to adopta true and suitable form oi narration, when it would not be
a case ol subomation. eA witness trained to express himself in
suitable ¹words is not said to be suborned, as Baldus also says else-
where. Aretinus says too that witnesses in disagreement, brought
lorward by one and the same party, are not brought into agreement
[in the trial], in order to prove a point, because the party bringing
them lorward has itself to blame, inasmucb as it has not instructed its
witnesses beforehand concerning the truth, or bas not known before·
hand what they were going to say.

Here I would note that a witness, however, ought not to prom·
ise anything definite, lor in that case he should be rejected according
to another distinction made by Baldus on this point. ‘What what
kind, how much: those are definite points. To have made a state·
ment in advance would not prejudice the case because that is not to
bave made a promise. However, it would not prejudice a case to
have made a promise, if it is lawiul to instruet witnesses, as the dictum
allows. Such a promise is usually ol no value, ‘since witnesses would
“ often ” make a promise and not keep it; they would say one thing
to a party concemed, another to the judge; it is to the party that
they would lie “ more frequentlyl' hStill the party, too, which has
