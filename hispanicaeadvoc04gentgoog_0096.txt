66 CHAPTER XV

Of tlte English W ho through the Assistanca os the Transury of tha
King of Barbary H ave Bouqht Property Taken
from tha Spaniards by Piratas.

⁸The opinion is correct which 1 gave in commenting on the con·
stitution of Zeno, that it is speaking of the fiscus oi one's own Prince,
that is, the Prince of the man whose property is at stake, ior all who
give an explanation oi this law take it in this way, that the Prince may
take from me the ownership oi my property. Now, surely this is
not true of a foreign prince. The laws are speaking oi the Prince
and they certainly do so only with regard to his subjecta. bFurther·
more, when the doctors say that the treasury spoken of is present
everywhere, they are likewise speaking oi the treasury oi one's own
Princo, for the treasury of another Prince would have no existence
here. Consequently, in realms distinct from one another that law
would not apply.

Now, as to the fact that the law gives redress against the treas·
ury, the Spaniards have no redress, at least against the fiscus oi the
King of Barbary.

Besides, this law does not apply where there is bad iaith on
the part oi the buyer, as Baldus quite correctly observes on that
point in a supplementary note-Fulgosius holds the same view-
whatever Baldus may write, on the other side in his first two treatises.
cOthers speak also of the good raith which the buyer ought to show,
and they mention other qualities too which must be assumed ln order
that this constitution may stand: that the Prince should have come
into possession and in good laith, das, again, others too remarks
that the buyers should be of good iaith on their part. But the Eng-
lish have bought some ol these goods directly from the pirates ancl
they knew that they were buying from pirates. eStill the fact would
have been enough, that they ought to have known it. They knew too
that what they bought there through the intervention of the fiscus
was booty left by the pirates, ior they saw these very pirates there,

07 and knew that all of the property must have come from the pirates,
and they recognized the same marks on all the chests. Let the judge
observe the bad faith of these merchants, who, when summoned here
to court, took pains to have these marks, which indicated the owners,
rubbed out and ellaced, and were caught in the act. ‘Theman who
