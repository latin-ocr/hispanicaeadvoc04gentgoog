The Pleas of a Spanish advocare, Bk. II. 133

usually read out). The conclusion follows too lrom the lact that
Hadrian says that there is no place in his court for “ written ‘²
evidence, for he indicates clearly enough that there is a place lor it
in the courts of others. ⁰⁰ Indeed, on the basis ol that law, Cujacius ,
and Brissonius make the observation that this was the situation alter
the downlall of the Republic; they add that while the Republic
continued absent persons, even by means of a written document,
did not give evidence in public trials, but they were required to
give oral evidence in person before the court. “ In public trials,’' they
say. Therefore before other judges even while the Republic
lasted it was not the practice [to exclude written testimony]. ‘¹⁶ Now
1 give in addition these words of Harmenopulus: “When accusations
are made it is undoubtedly necessary to produce the witnesses. Their
statements do not suffice.” Consequently, if in criminal actions it
is necessary for the witnesses to make a personal appearance, in
civil actions it is not necessary. This would be the eighth reason
offered in support of that party which we are delending, and this
party would not be put in the wrong by the reasons given on the
other side.

' Now, the first reason does not stand in the way, eesince even
the authority ol the Decretum would not be so cogent as to make law.
calixtus is not even speaking ol the situation which confronts us;
he is speaking ol absent persons, but our case concerns a witness who
is present and tells in a continuous written narrative what he knows
in the case.

The second argument does not stand in the way, because Clement 1
is talking ol a special case, as we noted, of an accusation involving
marriage. “ Concerning an accusation involving marriage ’' is the
issue there; “in such cases '’ is the response there; “in a matrimonial
action’' Panormitanus would understand the topic there. Now 1
was just saying that there were cases under the Roman Republic in
which this testimony would not be admitted, that it was not admitted
in criminal actions. The case discussed by Clement would be criminal. 131
It would be a matrimonial case which is regularly treated like a
criminal matter even in this connection, ¹² and it is also a special
characteristic of matrimony that proofs which are valid in connection
with another subject would not be valid here. Besides, as all writers
observe, the question there concerno divorce so that the prools required
should be so much the stronger and more particular. I would say that
that chapter deals with an accusation, not with testimony, and that it
has been put under the title on accusations, and that the part of
the rubric which has to do with testilying is lacking in some books.
“Moreoven as we are in the habitos accepting witnesses more
readily than judges, so perhaps they ought to be accepted more read·
