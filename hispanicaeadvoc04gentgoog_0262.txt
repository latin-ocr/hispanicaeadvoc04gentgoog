CHAPTER XXIX
Of the Sale of Thinqs Which A re Reckoned by W eight, Number, aad

Mensura

lf those articles which are regularly sold by number, weight,¹ or
measure are sold without specification, the condition is said to apper-
tain to the sale, “if they be counted, weighed, or measured,’' ‘as
the jurist clearly indicates by his distinction, that wine, for instance,
is either all sold in bulk, however much there may be, at a specified
235 price, and that in this case we should understand that the sale was
completed at once; or that it is sold in such a way that there isa ’
hxed price for each jar, and that then the sale would be complete,
when the wine has been measured, “since the transaction seems to be
carried out on the implied condition that for each jar which shall
have been measured out,’' says the jurist in that connection, l'and the
Emperor makes the same point of distinction. ² Baldus holds the same
‘ principle with reference to the sale of land according to measurement,
namely, that the sale would be conditional in this way, darrd he says ¹
that this point is proved, where he makes this observation. leasing ’
and sale, in the case of either personal or real property, is conditioned
on measurement, that is, it depende on the measurement found, even ,
if lixed limits have been determined, esu that consequently before
measurement has been made the transaction would not be eflected
under such a contract. ’
· ‚ ¹Now, the following conclusion is considered correct by all
writers, namely, that if we begin with the mass, and afterward men·
tion measurement, we should say that the sale was made of the
mass; the reverse would be true, if we began with a reference to
measurement. lt is said that in these circumstances the sale would be
conditional in the second case, even if the seller had given the buyer
liberty to use the purchase.· The same distinction is made by
Oldradus and commonly approved, that if we begin with words in-
volving number or measurement, nothing more may be taken into
consideration than is indicated by the specilied number. Otherwise
the added phrase· covering measurement is by way of a misleading
indication.
Now one is said to begin with a number, if the limits within
which a certain body is contained are not expressly stated in advance,
for we cannot otherwise say that a mass has been determined. For
