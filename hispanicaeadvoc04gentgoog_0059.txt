The Pleas os a Spanish Advocate, Bk. l. 33

inquire and take action concerning such cases, while the case of men
under escort is very rare. Expressions used to cover the commonet
occurrentes indeed do not limit the application ol the law, as in a
similar case, the glossator observes in a note to the hrst law ol
this title. Ν This principle is everywhere applicable. Bartolus, too,
understands the second law in this way: “ Those who are in churches
cannot be taken out against their will,” and he does not distinguish
how they got there. Suppose the case of those who do not flee there,
but are there, shall they be seizedl Are they to be taken out? The
rule is that no one may be taken irom there, and the case of escort
is evidently not expressly excepted. Therefore, we ought not to
except it. ⁸ This argument, Decianus himself uses once very properly
in discussing this very matter. ⁸⁸ Are we to think that a man under
sentence and on his way to punishment who meets a cardinal should
be set lree, but that he should not be set free by the sanctity and
mediating power ol a sacred place? ²² Likewise under the canon law
there is no such distinction as you make, ¹¹¹¹ and consequently under
the canon law the immunity of the church is violated in this case, ¹¹ while 32

we ought to hold to canon law in the mattei¹ of the immunity of a
church. Now, this is the view which we defend and which we call
the common view, and to the authorities lor it we can also add
Romanus and Jason and the others, who, although they are talking
of fugitives from justice, say that force may not be used in a church.
Even if this view were not the common one, Ι maintain that it
should be held, yybecause it supports religion and the immunity ol
churches, “because it has been sanctioned by usage and decisions
' reached after thorough discussion. Furthermore, we assert that the
custom which Decianus lreely cites against it does not exist. Neither
shall we find that it is the custom for men going under escort through
a church not to cry out, nor is it the custom lor thern to allow them·
selves to be led through without protest in their lorgetfulness or
ignorance of the law. ²⁸⁸ The view which supports religion, even il
stated at the ourset, we regard as approved, for the reasoning which
lavors religion carries the greatest weight.
