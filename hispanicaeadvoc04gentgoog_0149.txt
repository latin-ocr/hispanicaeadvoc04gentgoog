The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 123

from their treatment of others.’' ‘Deeds reveal the will behind them,
and this deed of the Tuscans is unjust, ⁸if it is true that not without
committing wrong the hunter trespasses on another man’s estate in
the face of the owner’s prohibition, and if it is not lawful to harm
an enemy on neutral territory, ¹‘and if territory is simply domain.
Let not that custom (in regard to this authority of warships)-if it

obtains anywhere—be thrust upon me now as a law of the sea, since
that custom may be admitted off the coasts of the prince who owns
the vessels, but not on another sea. ¹Further, no regard should be
had for those doctors who talk freely about the custom, but the
view of the rank and file should be observed.

¹‘“ The defense of the Englishmen was proper, because they
feared ofiense, ¹and simply because the other man is making ready
to attack me, I may lawfully take the ofiensive and slay him. Of
course, I do not have to wait till l am attached3 it is my duty to
begin myself.” This is said to be the more humane view, a view
tested in accordance with facts in the courts, and ‘⁴ approved, more· 121
over, by all the doctors.’' '² “ One should anticipate offense, that which
is potential as well as that which is actual.”

The defense made by the Englishmen was honorable also in be·
half of the Turks, who certainly would have been molested on board
the ship of our countrymen by the Tuscans. ”Thus wrong is done to
us when it is done to another who is in our home, ⁰ for a ship herself
is likened to a home. ¹’Thus likewise we regard a wrong inllicted
on our traveling companion as inllicted on ourselves. Defense ofiered
in protection of those whom we had undertaken to carry would have
been praiseworthy3 nor were we undeserving of mercy, even though
the passengers may not have been.

The defense offered by our men was necessary, because it was
in the fear that they themselves, along with the Turks, might sufier
some injury, and from the desire to save their property that they
rushed to arms. ‘¹⁸‘ This was the reply given by Cravetta in a more
hazardous case where a city closed its gates in the face of its sovereign
through fear of being sacked, and to save its property and to prevent
the vast majority of its innocent people from being involved in the
fate of a few who were guilty.’' ‘But then, if our people simply
defended themselves and that defense was justified, then the ofiense
of the Tuscans was unjustified. Or, suppose that the offense of the
Tuscans was justified also. “⁸ At least in the doubtful confiict be·
tween a justified ofiense and a justified defense there is no one who
will not give such a beneficent thing as defense the preference over
offense.‘' The more just surpasses the just, the more equitable, the
equitable, the more beneficent, the beneficeut, and the more just is
given the preference over the just
