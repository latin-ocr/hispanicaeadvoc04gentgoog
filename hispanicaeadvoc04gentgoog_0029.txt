CHAPTER I

s W herber There Is Postliminium in the Domain of a Common Friend

“A person who has reached a state or king allied or friendly
seems to have returned by postliminium,⁸ inasmuch as at that point,
through the authority of the state, his safety begins for the first
time‚'’ bsays the law, and another law reads: “It is understood that
a person is back again from the moment when he either reaches our
friends or sets foot within our fortified lines.’¹

But the question at issue was whether certain Lusitaniam, who
had been taken prisoners by Dutch enemies on the Spanish sea,
became free here in England, by way of which they were being taken
to Holland. And it was thought that here in the domain of a com-
mon friend they do not become free, because the law does not
speak of “a common friend ” but expressly mentions “our friend.’‘
cIndeed “ our ” may mean something quite different from “ common,'’
and this opinion is generally held by the doctors. -And in this
way those laws concerning allies bound to one people only, and ene·
mles of the other party,‘³ are interpreted by the doctors who
hold that a state has the power to decide under these laws that its
enemy may be put to death in an allied state. Which is clearly untrue
for a state having a common alliance [i.e.‚ allied with both parties].
Furthermore‚ Baldus expressly adopts this interpretation in the case
of enemies of the other party. Likewise Baldus also applies the 2
same laws to the friends of the Roman peoplee who were usually
required to hold as friends and as enemies those whom that imperial
people held as friends and as enemies.

Furthermore‚ it may seem that Romans did not return by postli-
minium on coming to a common friend. Or why is it that‘ there were ‚
in Greece a great many slaves of Roman descent whom fortune had
brought there during the Punic War? Did the Achaeans set them

’ free and give them to Quintius? Was Greece not friendly but
unfriendly to the Romans?

⁸Finally that postliminium may not exist in the domain of a
common friend Antonius Gama makes a show of establishing in his
Lusitanian decisions-a lusitanian authority who ought to count for
a great deal against Lusitaniam, although he has none of the afore·
