CHAPTER XIX

ΟῘ Definiteness of Price in Buyinq, and os a Permanent Trustee sor
One’s Own Property

Peter sold and made over to Philip certain revenues which were
to be his in the House of Saint-George at Genoa; but now that they
have become his, he is unwilling that this contract should be kept;
and it seems that he is within his rights in taking this position. ‘No
sale can stand which does not have a definite price, and there is no
definite price unless a quantity of'something is stated and defined.
ιἈ thing is definite when the quantity of itis indicated: and this has

not been done in this case where it is merely said that the contract
was entered into ‘⁴ in consideration of a certain sufficient sum, etc.’'
“A price is not definite even though it has been described as ‘⁸ fair,'’
therefore, neither is it definite when it is described as sufficient. ‘¹Of
course, it is the custom to estimare prices in the case of purchases
according to the desire of the parties to the contract and not accord·
ing to the value of the articles themselves; and, consequently, the
contracting parties are allowed to deceive themselves in that con·
nection l. in causae 2, ἓ idem Pomponius, ff, De ηιὶηονίὸιιε).ι Then,
too, when Philip said that he was appointed receiver and trustee for

his own property permanently—as it is in the instrument-and, ·
therefore, could institute proceedings to recover those revenues, the
defense would lie ready to Peter’s hand that he could recall that
order, no matter what might be said about its permanent nature, even
though made under oath and with a penalty attached. eSuch is the 211
common opinion of the doctors. These and other considerations of

the same sort favor Peter.

But, again, we have against him the consideration ‘that nothing
is so in keeping with the trust which men should have in one another,
as that decisione once taken should be adhered to always. ‘Nothing
is so natural and in consonante with equity as giving effect to the
intention of the man who wishes to make a transfer to another.
Another point against Peter is made by the rule hthat a person may
give over even future and conditional rights and alienate revenues on
any other pretext. And therefore Peter, who could alienate those
future revenues and has so alienated them, should now adhere to his
decision. Peter is the usufructuary, iand the usufructuary can sell,
grant, or donate the usufruct.
