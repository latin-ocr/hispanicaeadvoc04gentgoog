CHAVrER XVIII
Of an Ambassador Actinq [or the Subsects of His Kinq

. The objection has often been raised that an ambassador cannot
ἱ manage the cases of his King‘s subjects, and people add that the
‘lowly task of managing lawsuits belongs to the deputy, but is be-
neath the dignity of an ambassador. 1Ἀῐι ambassador, they say,
should have nothing to do with business allairs, whether his own or
another's. But our position is this. Accursius and others do indeed
call the office of deputy a burden, eand certain individuals charac-
terize it as a lowly and disreputable office, but the law appears to make
this statement of the deputy with reference to his business duties,
not with reference to lawsuits. Then in other cases too that objec-
tion does not hold. dWetl, is it not a high honor to be the deputy
of a sovereign? Even the King’s notary is in high honor, although
75 the notary at other times is an insignificant person. eWhatever is
imposed by the sovereign is a high honor. Mark the ennobling law,
says Andreas de Bamlo ‘Then in the case of learned deputies,
when they even have a college, the reproach is unmerited.
⁸Well, are ambassadors not nuncios? ¹¹Are they not holders
of a trust? Again, the ambassador in this case fills the office of
deputy in precisely the same way as a sovereign, even the highest,
does when he appoints a deputy and does not appear at the barin
person. iIn this way ‘⁴ the task does not make a heavy demand,'‘
and the ambassador could perform it. Even before the suit is
entered he can appoint a deputy, who by no means has to come into
court, and who has this privilege because he has not become the
owner by attesting. Why are these objections raised to a deputy with
such an honorable commissioni Is the commission demanded? ¹‘He
is not forced to show it. But Ῑ show from the law ¹thata sovereign
is in duty bound to defend and care for his subjects and their prop
erty. Therefore his ambassador too would be bound to take this
care of his sovereign‘s subjects and the property of his sovereign's
subjects, since the ambassador stands in the place of his sovereign.
¹² F urther, I have shown in my books “ οη Embassies‚” and others
following me in this held have shown, that these private interests
too come under the care of ambassadors. ¹¹ Besides, an ambassador
just like anyone else can intervene here in the defense even of prop·

erty‚ andsto the extent of taking the matter into court;, here especially,
