same matter be at issue. These points may not be made against me,
179 ll lor a verdict pronounced against a tenant injures the owner, if be
knew of the verdict only, and makes no appeal-at least it injures
him in the matter of possession. So the objection is turned against
our adversaries, and when it is said that an owner is not injured by
a verdict against a tenant, in that case the statement made has own-
ership in mind, and ownership is not intrusted to a tenant, since
possession is granted to him, or the question involves an owner who
does not know of the suit. ω 11 it is even said that no injury is done
in the matter of possession, that applies to civil rights which have not
been granted to the tenant. ⁶⁶ The common opinion is that knowl-
edge of 3 suit injures a third party in the matter of possession, and
Cravetta urges this point vigorously, and he urges the common view
when ‘⁴ the third party ‘' holds possession, 3ηά this should be ob·
served‚ for ‘² “ in this case < said Covarruvias) without doubt a ver·
dict ought not to be handed down for execution.” Romanus says that
a verdier will ‘⁸ never '’ be handed down for execution against a third
party who has possession, even if he shall have known that his
own interests were at stake‚ and even if he shall have received a
summons and kept silence, for he may wish to retain possession only,
although he would not be heard, if he wished afterward to take ac·
tion against the man who had a verdict in his favor, for an exception
to the res iudicata would stand in his way. ffEven Zucchardus holds
the same view, and he also cites Castrensis. ⁸⁸ Imola too holds this
opinion, 3ηά he cites Bartolus as well and he adds here an excellent
point in practice, which others also set down elsewhere. As for my·
seli, 1 say that one should see whether the right of possession of the
defeated and third parties is the same or not, for in the second
situation it would surely be a more correct and the common view
that a verdict pronounced against one person does not injure a
third party who knows 3ηά is in possession, but this third party will
be ableto hinder execution on the ground of possession only. Jason
gives evidence of this common opinion and sets it forth, 3ηά Cravetta
does not oppose it in this connection, or does not oppose it ellectively.
But il there is the same right of possession for both, one ought
180 not to doubt that 3 verdict injures the third party; for instance, a
verdict brought against a tenant, who holds possession lor an owner,
injures the owner; one pronounced against a navigator, who holds
possession for owners, will injure the owners, llSurely he “ in
whose name possession is held ” holds possession. ‘¹ An agent gives
his services in behalf of another’s possession,” 3ηά the possession in
this case ol that other person is real.
No one may oppose me by saying that the verdict pronounced
in this case against the navigator does not injure the owner, because
