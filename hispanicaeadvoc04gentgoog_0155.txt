 

CHAPTER I
Of the Deposition of One W ho Is Absent

One of our witnesses offered his testimony in writing to the ἴ
judge. The assertion was made that it was oi no value, and this
was what I thought. 'Indeed I read our doctors, and Ι found
that all the writers on canon law and that others uniformly report
that they are led to hold this view by many cogent arguments; in
the first place, by a letter ol Calixtus, which leads, as it were, to a
direct conclusion. In it are these words: ¹’“ Witnesses should not
give their testimony in any written form whatsoever, but should
present it in person and orally.”² In the second place, the rescript
of Clement III is cited: ⁰“ We have been asked whether, touching
an accusation involving matrimony, certain persons who oller no
testimony by word of mouth should be allowed to appear by means
of a mere statement in writing on a piece ol paper. To this we reply
that in such cases, except by way oi presumption‚ a written statement
is ol no weight, so far as reaching a decision is concerned, unless
other legal confirmation support it.”² Now, it is to be observed
that both decretals reject written documents oi all sorts and require 126
an oral statement and word of mouth.

In the third place a rather strong argument is drawn irorn both
decretals, to the ellect ‘¹that a judge ought to consider the voice oi
the witness and should observe the agitation which he feels, and shows
in his speech, and should interrogate the witness in person, and points
like this are noted which would not be in his power in the case of one
who puts his testimony in writing. Likewise they even maintain that
in an inquiry a representative should not be admitted in the case of
criminal action. ⁰“ We blush at saying many things which we do
not blush to set down in writing,” says Baldus. ‘⁸‘ For a letter has ¹
no blushes,” says Cicero.

The fourth argument is ‘that a discourse worked over colors
evidence, and a written discourse would be one which had been
worked over. Now in consequence of this argument, Felynus in a
vigorous way and the teacher of Felynus (hFranciscus Aretinus)
support the view ol Salycetus, ¹who says that he does not approve

. ol such a witness, even il he in person read to the judge the document
in which his testimony is contained, because (they say) such a wit·
